# E-Commerce Brand Business OS

An AI-powered Business Operating System for running an e-commerce brand with Claude Code. Built on 13 productivity principles refined over 20 years, this system automates planning, tracks productivity, maintains strategic alignment, and generates brand-aligned content at scale.

## Overview

This repository contains two integrated components:

1. **Business Operating System** (`claude-code-os-implementation/`) — A structured framework of AI agents, templates, workflows, and knowledge bases organized into 10 departments. Designed to be used with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) as the execution layer.

2. **AI Content Agents** (`ai-content-agents/`) — A Python toolkit that uses the Anthropic API to generate brand-aligned marketing content across blog, social media, Amazon listings, and competitor analysis channels.

The business context is **Infinity Vault**, a premium trading card binder brand sold via Amazon FBA, positioned as "Battle-Ready Equipment" for serious TCG/Pokemon collectors and tournament players.

## AI Content Agents

A Python-based content generation system with four specialized agents:

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **BlogAgent** | SEO-optimized blog posts, listicles, how-to guides, series outlines |
| **SocialAgent** | Instagram captions, Reddit posts, carousel scripts, content calendars |
| **AmazonAgent** | Product titles, bullet points, descriptions, A+ content, backend keywords |
| **CompetitorAgent** | Listing analysis, review mining, multi-competitor comparison, content gap identification |

All generated content is automatically infused with the Infinity Vault brand voice and "Battle-Ready" positioning.

See [`ai-content-agents/README.md`](ai-content-agents/README.md) for full usage instructions.

## Architecture

The system follows a **hybrid monorepo architecture** that separates business knowledge from execution logic:

### Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Business knowledge (markdown) is separated from execution logic (Python)
2. **Inheritance-Based Agent Design**: All specialized agents inherit from a common `BaseAgent` class
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Brand context and settings are centralized in configuration files
4. **Path-Based Organization**: Clear directory structure for discoverability and maintenance
5. **Zero Friction Execution**: Simple CLI interfaces and minimal setup requirements

### Agent Hierarchy

```
BaseAgent (base_agent.py)
    │
    ├── BlogAgent - SEO-optimized long-form content
    ├── SocialAgent - Platform-specific social media content
    ├── AmazonAgent - E-commerce listing optimization
    └── CompetitorAgent - Market analysis and insights
```

### Data Flow

```
Brand Knowledge (markdown) → config.py → BaseAgent → Specialized Agent → Anthropic API → Generated Content
```

All agents automatically load brand voice, strategy, and positioning from the knowledge layer and inject it into their prompts.

## API

The AI Content Agents system provides both CLI and programmatic interfaces:

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

```bash
# Universal content generation
python generate_content.py blog post "Your Topic" --pillar "Battle-Ready Lifestyle" --words 1500
python generate_content.py social instagram "Topic" --image "Image description"
python generate_content.py amazon title "Product Name" --features "feature1,feature2"
```

### Python API

```python
from agents import BlogAgent, SocialAgent, AmazonAgent

# Generate blog post
blog_agent = BlogAgent()
content, path = blog_agent.generate_blog_post(
    topic="10 Tournament Mistakes TCG Players Make",
    content_pillar="Battle-Ready Lifestyle",
    word_count=1500
)

# Generate social content
social_agent = SocialAgent()
content, path = social_agent.generate_instagram_post(
    topic="Pre-tournament ritual",
    content_pillar="Battle-Ready Lifestyle"
)
```

### REST API (Planned)

A FastAPI-based REST API is planned for Phase 2, exposing:
- `POST /api/content/generate` - Universal content generation
- `POST /api/blog/generate` - Blog-specific generation
- `POST /api/social/generate` - Social media generation
- `POST /api/amazon/generate` - Amazon listing optimization

**Read more:** [`docs/API_DESIGN.md`](docs/API_DESIGN.md)

## Testing

The system maintains **70% minimum test coverage** to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

### Running Tests

```bash
cd ai-content-agents

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=ai-content-agents --cov-report=term-missing

# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=ai-content-agents --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html

# Fail if coverage is below 70%
pytest --cov=ai-content-agents --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=70
```

### Test Structure

```
ai-content-agents/tests/
├── conftest.py                 # Shared fixtures
├── fixtures/                   # Mock API responses
├── test_base_agent.py          # BaseAgent tests
├── test_blog_agent.py          # BlogAgent tests
├── test_social_agent.py        # SocialAgent tests
├── test_amazon_agent.py        # AmazonAgent tests
└── test_api.py                 # API integration tests
```

### Testing Philosophy

- **Test First, Fix Later**: Write tests before implementing new features
- **Isolated Testing**: Tests should not rely on external services (mocked APIs)
- **Fast Feedback**: Unit tests run in seconds
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Integration tests mirror actual usage

## The 13 Foundational Principles

These principles, refined over 20 years, form the backbone of the system:

**Foundation Philosophy**
1. The Entropy Principle — Accept imperfection, focus on what matters
2. Zero Friction Discipline — Remove barriers to create sustainable discipline
3. The Spartan Rule — Lean operations with brutal elimination

**Execution Mechanics**
4. Breaking Constraints — Find the bottleneck and break it
5. Today Over Tomorrow — Execute now, plan later
6. Input Over Output — Control what you can control

**Strategic Alignment**
7. One Big Obsessional Goal (OBG) — Single-point focus
8. Strategic Filtering — Every action must serve the OBG
9. Alignment Checking — Continuous verification against priorities

**Force Multipliers**
10. AI Agent Teams — Specialized agents for specialized tasks
11. Compound Learning — Every interaction improves the system
12. Persistent Memory — No lost context or forgotten projects
13. Frictionless Execution — Systems that run themselves
