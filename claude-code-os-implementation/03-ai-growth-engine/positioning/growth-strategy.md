# Growth Strategy - Infinity Vault

## Growth Philosophy
*How we think about growth aligned with our values and OBG*

### Growth Principles
1. **Sustainable over explosive**: Build lasting brand value, not flash sales
2. **Profitable over vanity**: CM3% matters more than revenue alone
3. **Identity-driven over commodity**: Growth through positioning, not price wars
4. **Multi-layered moat over single advantage**: Build defensible competitive position
5. **Community-validated over marketing-manufactured**: Authentic growth through LGS and tournaments

### Strategic Foundation
**Primary Objective**: Transform from commodity storage provider to premium, identity-driven brand
**3-Year Revenue Target**: Scale to $5-10M annually
**Exit Valuation Target**: $5.6M - $9.4M
