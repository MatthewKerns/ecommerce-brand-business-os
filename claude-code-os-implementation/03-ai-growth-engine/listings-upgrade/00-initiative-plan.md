## Why Now: The AI Acceleration Opportunity

AI tools have fundamentally changed the speed at which we can:
- Research competitors and identify positioning gaps
- Refine brand messaging for emotional resonance
- Generate high-converting listing copy variations
- Identify and reach on-brand influencers at scale

This initiative leverages AI to compress what used to take weeks into days. This is a core part of the **AI Growth Engine** in this repository.
