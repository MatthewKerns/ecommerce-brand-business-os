---

### Beat 2: Context Setup (3-8 seconds)

**Purpose**: Establish why this matters and connect to viewer's pain point

**Script Template**:
```
"[Why this matters] + [Common problem/mistake] + [What you'll learn]"

EXAMPLES - Problem First:
"I used to just stack cards in any binder... scratched three expensive ones before I learned this.
Let me show you the right way to protect valuable cards."

EXAMPLES - Mistake Callout:
"Most people organize by set or color... but that actually makes finding cards harder.
Here's the system tournament players use."

EXAMPLES - Value Emphasis:
"When you have $1,000+ in cards, organization isn't optional... it's protection.
This system keeps everything safe and accessible."

EXAMPLES - Time Saver:
"Spending 30 minutes looking for one card? This system cuts that to 30 seconds.
Here's exactly how to set it up."
```

**Visual**:
- Show the problem (messy cards, scratched card, etc.)
- Your face briefly (builds connection)
- Quick preview of what they'll learn
- Materials you'll be using

**Delivery Tips**:

---

### Beat 3: Materials/Setup (8-15 seconds)

**Purpose**: Show what's needed so viewer can follow along

**Script Template**:
```
"[What you need] + [Quick notes about materials]"

EXAMPLES - Simple Setup:
"You'll need: a quality binder with side-loading pages, divider tabs, and your cards.
I use the Infinity Vault because the scratch-resistant pages matter for this."

EXAMPLES - Minimal Materials:
"All you need is your binder and 5 minutes. That's it. No special tools."

EXAMPLES - Alternative Options:
"I'm using this premium binder, but this works with any binder that has side-loading pockets.
Just make sure the pages are scratch-resistant."

EXAMPLES - Setup Note:
"Before you start: lay everything out on a clean surface. Trust me, it's way easier.
Here's what your setup should look like..."
```

**Visual**:
- Overhead shot of all materials laid out
- Clean, organized presentation
- Label items if possible (text overlay)
- Your hands organizing the setup

**Pro Tip**: Product placement happens naturally here - mention your product as the tool, not the focus.

**Delivery Tips**:

- Mention why specific materials matter (especially your product)
- Keep it simple - don't overwhelm
- Transition into first step smoothly

---

### Beat 4: Step-by-Step Process (15-45 seconds)

**Purpose**: Teach the actual skill with clear, followable instruction

**Script Template (3-Step Process)**:
```
"Step 1: [Action] + [Why] → Step 2: [Action] + [Why] → Step 3: [Action] + [Why]"

EXAMPLE - Card Organization Tutorial:
"Step 1: Sort your cards by rarity first, not by set.
This makes finding your valuable cards instant. *demonstrates sorting*

Step 2: Use these dividers to separate each rarity tier.
I label mine: Chase Cards, Mid-Tier, Bulk. *shows labeling*

Step 3: Within each section, organize alphabetically.
This way you can find any specific card in seconds. *demonstrates placement*"

EXAMPLE - Proper Card Storage Tutorial:
"Step 1: Clean your cards gently with a microfiber cloth before storing.
Dust and dirt cause scratches over time. *demonstrates cleaning*

Step 2: Load cards into side-loading pockets, not top-loading.
Side-loading prevents cards from sliding out. *shows technique*

Step 3: Never overfill pockets. One card per pocket for valuable cards,
two max for bulk. Pressure causes damage. *demonstrates proper spacing*"

EXAMPLE - Binder Maintenance Tutorial:
"Step 1: Check your pages monthly for any damage or warping.
Caught early, you can prevent card damage. *shows inspection*

Step 2: Clean the pages with a microfiber cloth... never use cleaning solution.
Chemicals can damage the protective coating. *demonstrates*

Step 3: Store your binder flat, never on its side.
This prevents pressure damage and keeps rings aligned. *shows proper storage*"
```

**Visual**:
- Close-up of your hands doing each step
- Overhead angle for full process view
- Step numbers as text overlays
- Slow motion for critical moments
- Show each step completing before moving on

**Pacing**:
- 8-12 seconds per step for 3-step process
- 5-8 seconds per step for 4-5 step process
- Pause briefly between steps
- Keep hands and materials in frame

**Pro Tips for Steps**:
- Always explain WHY, not just what (builds understanding)
- Show mistakes to avoid during each step
- Keep language simple and active ("do this" not "you'll want to")
- Demonstrate as you talk (show, don't just tell)

**Delivery Tips**:
- Speak clearly and at medium pace (people may be following along)
- Number your steps verbally ("Step 1... Step 2...")
- Pause between steps (editing will tighten this)
- Keep energy up but not rushed

---

### Beat 5: Pro Tip/Common Mistake (45-52 seconds)

**Purpose**: Add extra value and help troubleshoot

**Script Template**:
```
"[Pro tip] or [Common mistake to avoid] or [Bonus insight]"

EXAMPLES - Pro Tip:
"Pro tip: photograph your organization system.
When you're at tournaments or trades, you'll know exactly what you have. Game changer."

EXAMPLES - Common Mistake:
"Biggest mistake I see: people organize once and never update.
Set a reminder to reorganize monthly. Your system only works if you maintain it."

EXAMPLES - Time Saver:
"Here's the shortcut: keep a small section for 'recent adds.'
Throw new cards there, then reorganize in batches. Saves so much time."

EXAMPLES - Quality Note:
"One thing that matters: page quality. Cheap pages cause scratching no matter how careful you are.
That's why I only use binders with scratch-resistant pages now."

EXAMPLES - Troubleshooting:
"If your cards are still getting scratched, check this: are your pages warped?
Even slight warping increases friction. Replace those pages immediately."
```

**Visual**:

[Visual: Show proper storage setup]

[50-60s] ZIPPER CARE
"Fourth: Zipper maintenance. If your binder has a zipper, keep it clean.
Wipe the zipper teeth monthly... dirt causes sticking which leads to forcing it,
which leads to zipper failure."

[60-68s] PRO TIP

and every page thoroughly. Catches problems early."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Too Fast
**What it looks like**: Racing through steps, no time to see details
**Why it fails**: Viewers can't follow along, get frustrated, leave
**Fix**: Slow down, let each step breathe, pause between steps

### ❌ Mistake 2: Assuming Knowledge
**What it looks like**: Skipping basic steps, using jargon without explanation
**Why it fails**: Beginners feel lost and intimidated
**Fix**: Explain everything, define terms, assume zero knowledge

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Clear Steps
**What it looks like**: Rambling through process without structure
**Why it fails**: Confusing to follow, hard to remember, not rewatchable
**Fix**: Number steps clearly, separate each step visually

### ❌ Mistake 4: Poor Lighting/Angles
**What it looks like**: Can't see what you're doing, shadows obscure details
**Why it fails**: Visual instruction requires visibility
**Fix**: Overhead lighting, test camera angle before filming

### ❌ Mistake 5: All Talk, Little Show
**What it looks like**: Talking about steps without demonstrating them
**Why it fails**: TikTok viewers need to see it to understand it
**Fix**: Demonstrate every single step on camera

### ❌ Mistake 6: No Context
**What it looks like**: Diving into steps without explaining why
**Why it fails**: Viewers don't understand importance or relevance
**Fix**: Start with problem this solves or benefit of learning it

### ❌ Mistake 7: Skipping the Result
**What it looks like**: Tutorial ends mid-process or without showing outcome
**Why it fails**: No payoff, no inspiration, no proof it works
**Fix**: Always show finished result, celebrate the outcome
