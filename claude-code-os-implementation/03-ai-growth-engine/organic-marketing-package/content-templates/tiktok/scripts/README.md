# TikTok Video Script Frameworks

## What Are Script Frameworks?

**Script frameworks** are complete structural templates for TikTok videos that guide you from hook to call-to-action. While hooks get viewers to stop scrolling, scripts keep them watching and drive them to action.

**A Script Framework's Job**: Deliver value, build trust, and create a clear path to conversion—all in 15-60 seconds.

## Why Script Frameworks Matter

TikTok success isn't just about grabbing attention—it's about holding it and converting it. A strong script framework:
- **Maintains engagement** - Keeps viewers watching after the hook
- **Delivers value** - Provides entertainment, education, or emotion
- **Builds trust** - Establishes credibility and authenticity
- **Drives action** - Leads naturally to saves, shares, and purchases

**Reality**: A strong hook without a solid script is wasted potential. The hook gets them to watch; the script gets them to convert.

## The Universal Script Structure

Every high-performing TikTok script follows this fundamental flow:

### 1. **Hook (0-3 seconds)**
Stop the scroll and create curiosity
- Use hook templates from [hooks library](../hooks/README.md)
- Make it visually interesting immediately
- Create a question that demands an answer

### 2. **Value Delivery (4-30 seconds)**
Answer the hook's promise and provide value
- Show, don't just tell
- Use clear, concise language
- Maintain visual interest with dynamic shots
- Build credibility through demonstration

### 3. **Credibility Layer (Optional, 10-20 seconds)**
Reinforce trust and authority
- Social proof (testimonials, results)
- Demonstration of expertise
- Transparency and authenticity

### 4. **Call-to-Action (Final 3-5 seconds)**
Direct viewers to the next step
- Save this for later
- Share with someone who needs this
- Link in bio for [specific benefit]
- Follow for more [specific value]

## TikTok Script Best Practices

### Timing Guidelines

| Video Length | Content Strategy |
|--------------|------------------|
| **15-30 seconds** | Single point, fast-paced, hook-driven |
| **30-45 seconds** | Primary point + credibility or bonus tip |
| **45-60 seconds** | Complete framework with multiple value points |

**Key Insight**: TikTok rewards completion rate. Better to deliver full value in 30 seconds than stretch thin content to 60 seconds.

### Pacing Rules

1. **Front-load value** - Deliver on the hook immediately
2. **One point per 10 seconds** - Don't overcomplicate
3. **Visual changes every 3-5 seconds** - Maintain attention
4. **End with energy** - Don't fade out, go out strong

### Language Best Practices

#### Do's ✅
- **Use "you" language** - Make it personal and direct
- **Be conversational** - Talk like you're texting a friend
- **Stay specific** - "Scratch-resistant pages" beats "quality materials"
- **Show results** - "Save $200 in damaged cards" beats "protective"
- **Create urgency** - "Before you buy another cheap binder..."

#### Don'ts ❌
- **No corporate speak** - "Innovative solution" kills engagement
- **No filler words** - Every second counts
- **No buried payoff** - Give value early and often
- **No weak CTAs** - "Check link in bio" lacks motivation
- **No apologies** - Own your expertise

## Script Writing Workflow

### Step 1: Define Your Goal
What specific action do you want viewers to take after watching?
- Save this video?
- Click link in bio?
- Share with a friend?
- Follow for more content?

### Step 2: Choose Your Framework
Based on your goal and content type, select the appropriate framework.

### Step 3: Select Your Hook
Pick a hook from the [hooks library](../hooks/README.md) that pairs well with your chosen framework.

### Step 4: Fill in the Framework
Use the framework template and replace placeholders with your specific content.

### Step 5: Time It Out
Read the script aloud and time it. Adjust pacing to hit your target length.

### Step 6: Plan Your Visuals
Map each script beat to specific shots or visual moments.

### Step 7: Test and Iterate
Record, post, analyze performance, and refine your approach.

## Script Testing & Optimization

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Completion Rate** - % who watch to the end
   - Target: 50%+ for videos under 30 seconds
   - Target: 40%+ for videos 30-60 seconds

2. **Engagement Rate** - Likes + Comments + Shares / Views
   - Target: 5%+ is strong
   - Target: 10%+ is viral-worthy

3. **Save Rate** - Saves / Views
   - Target: 2%+ is good
   - Target: 5%+ is exceptional

4. **Click-Through Rate** - Link clicks / Views
   - Target: 1%+ is decent
   - Target: 3%+ is strong

### Performance Indicators

#### Green Lights ✅
- 50%+ watch the full video
- Comments asking "where to buy?"
- High save rate (viewers want to reference later)
- Shares to friends
- Profile visits and follows

#### Red Flags ❌
- Drop-off after hook (script didn't deliver)
- Low engagement despite good views (interesting but not valuable)
- Confused comments (script was unclear)
- No link clicks (weak CTA or poor motivation)

### A/B Testing Scripts

Test these variables one at a time:
- **Hook variation** - Same script, different opening
- **Pacing** - Faster vs. slower delivery
- **CTA placement** - Middle vs. end
- **Script length** - 30 vs. 45 vs. 60 seconds
- **Value proposition** - Feature-focused vs. benefit-focused

## Script Customization Best Practices

### Product Adaptation
Every framework can be customized for your specific product:

1. **Replace product-specific terms** - Binder → Your product
2. **Adapt pain points** - Match your audience's actual frustrations
3. **Adjust technical depth** - Match your audience's expertise
4. **Modify tone** - Professional, casual, energetic, etc.

### Brand Voice Integration
Maintain authenticity while using frameworks:

- ✅ Use frameworks as structure, not verbatim scripts
- ✅ Inject your personality and speaking style
- ✅ Add personal anecdotes and experiences
- ✅ Modify language to match your natural delivery

### Category-Specific Tweaks
Different product categories need different approaches:

| Category | Script Emphasis |
|----------|----------------|
| **High-value items** | Trust, quality, social proof |
| **Impulse purchases** | Emotion, urgency, desire |
| **Problem-solvers** | Pain point, solution, proof |
| **Status products** | Aspiration, exclusivity, flex |

## Common Script Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Burying the Payoff
**Problem**: Taking too long to deliver on the hook's promise
**Fix**: Deliver value in first 10 seconds after hook

### ❌ Mistake 2: Information Overload
**Problem**: Trying to cover too much in one video
**Fix**: One clear message per video

### ❌ Mistake 3: Weak Endings
**Problem**: Fading out instead of driving action
**Fix**: End with energy and clear CTA

### ❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring the Visual
**Problem**: Writing for audio only
**Fix**: Plan visual beats alongside script beats

### ❌ Mistake 5: Corporate Language
**Problem**: Sounding like an ad instead of content
**Fix**: Talk like you're helping a friend, not selling to a customer

### ❌ Mistake 6: No Clear CTA
**Problem**: Leaving viewers wondering "what now?"
**Fix**: Always end with one specific, motivated action

## Advanced Script Techniques

### The Pattern Break
Interrupt the expected flow to re-capture attention mid-video:
```
[Standard script flow]
*Suddenly* - "Wait, I need to show you this first..."
[Continue with new angle]
```

### The Loop
Reference the hook at the end to create satisfying closure:
```
Hook: "I'm about to scratch a $300 card..."
End: "And that's why I'll never worry about scratching cards again"
```

### The Value Stack
Layer multiple benefits throughout the script:
```
0-10s: Solves Problem A
10-20s: Also prevents Problem B
20-30s: Plus this bonus benefit
30s+: Here's where to get it
```

### The Social Proof Injection
Weave in credibility signals naturally:
```
"After three of my tournament buddies told me about this..."
"Everyone in my card collecting group uses..."
"I've been testing this for 6 months..."
```

*"A hook without a script is like a promise without a payoff. The hook gets them to watch. The script gets them to act."*
