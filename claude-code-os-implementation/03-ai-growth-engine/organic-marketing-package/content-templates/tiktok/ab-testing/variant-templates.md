## Pro Tips for Creating Variants

1. **Make Variants Different Enough**: 10% different = hard to measure. 50% different = clear signal.

2. **Keep Everything Else Identical**: If testing hooks, keep script, CTA, and visuals identical.

3. **Use Winning Variants as New Controls**: After Test B wins, it becomes your new Variant A (control) for the next test.

4. **Build a Variant Library**: Document all winning variants in a "proven winners" document.

5. **Test Regularly**: Run at least 2 tests per month to continuously optimize.

*"Every variant is a hypothesis. Every test is a learning opportunity. Every winner is a new baseline to beat."*
