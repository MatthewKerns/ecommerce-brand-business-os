# TikTok Content Template Performance Tracker

## Tracking Strategy

**Goal**: Systematically track which content templates drive the highest engagement, saves, and conversions to optimize content creation over time.

**Approach**: Data-driven template optimization. Track every video against its template to identify patterns in what works. What gets measured gets optimized.

---

## Why Track Template Performance?

**The Problem**: Creating content without tracking = guessing what works. You might create a viral video and never know which template elements made it successful.

**The Solution**: Track every video by template type to:
- Identify which templates consistently outperform others
- Understand which hooks drive the most engagement
- Optimize your content calendar around proven winners
- Scale what works, eliminate what doesn't
