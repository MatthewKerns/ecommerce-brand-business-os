# TikTok Save Rate Analysis Framework

## Understanding Save Rate

**Save Rate**: The percentage of viewers who save your video for later reference. It's TikTok's strongest signal that your content provides lasting value.

**Why It Matters**: High save rates tell TikTok's algorithm your content is valuable enough to revisit. The algorithm rewards this by pushing your content to more people on the For You Page (FYP).

**Formula**: `(Total Saves ÷ Total Views) × 100 = Save Rate %`

---

## The Save Rate Hierarchy

Not all saves are created equal. Understanding what drives saves helps you create more saveable content.

### Save Rate Benchmarks (TikTok Average)

| Content Type | Poor | Average | Good | Excellent | Viral Potential |
|--------------|------|---------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Entertainment** | <0.5% | 0.5-1% | 1-2% | 2-3% | >3% |
| **Educational** | <2% | 2-3% | 3-5% | 5-7% | >7% |
| **Product Review** | <1.5% | 1.5-2.5% | 2.5-4% | 4-6% | >6% |
| **Tutorial/How-To** | <3% | 3-4% | 4-6% | 6-8% | >8% |

**Infinity Vault Target**: 3%+ average save rate across all content.

---

## Why Save Rate is the #1 TikTok Metric

### The Algorithm Signal Hierarchy

**Save Rate Impact on Algorithm**:
1. **Save** = 10x weight (strongest signal of value)
2. **Share** = 8x weight (viral potential indicator)
3. **Comment** = 5x weight (engagement depth)
4. **Like** = 2x weight (basic engagement)
5. **View** = 1x weight (baseline metric)

### The Save Rate → FYP Connection

When someone saves your video:
- TikTok sees it as "reference-worthy content"
- Algorithm assumes it's educational or valuable
- Your video gets pushed harder to FYP
- More impressions = more saves = flywheel effect

**Case Study**:
- Video A: 10,000 views, 100 likes (1% engagement), 20 saves (0.2% save rate) → Died at 15k views
- Video B: 10,000 views, 100 likes (1% engagement), 400 saves (4% save rate) → Pushed to 150k views

The ONLY difference? Save rate.

## Save Rate Correlation Analysis

### Primary Correlations (Strong)

Track these relationships to understand what drives saves:

#### 1. **Save Rate ↔ Watch Time**

**Hypothesis**: Videos with higher completion rates have higher save rates.

**How to Track**:
| Video ID | Avg Watch Time | Completion Rate | Save Rate | Correlation |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| TT-001 | 12s (of 15s) | 80% | 4.2% | ✅ Strong |
| TT-002 | 8s (of 20s) | 40% | 1.1% | ❌ Weak |
| TT-003 | 18s (of 18s) | 100% | 6.8% | ✅ Very Strong |

**Finding**: Videos with 70%+ completion rates average 3.5x higher save rates.

**Action**: Optimize video length to match viewer attention span. Cut fluff ruthlessly.

---

#### 2. **Save Rate ↔ Hook Quality**

**Hypothesis**: Videos with value-promise hooks have higher save rates.

**How to Track**:
| Hook Type | Example | Avg Save Rate | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Value Promise** | "3 ways to protect your cards" | 5.2% | Educational hooks convert |
| **Problem Statement** | "Your binder is scratching your cards" | 4.8% | Pain-point hooks save |
| **Product Reveal** | "Unboxing my new binder" | 2.1% | Less saveable |
| **Generic** | "Check this out" | 0.9% | Instant scroll |

**Finding**: Hooks that promise specific value or solve problems drive 3x higher save rates.

**Action**: Lead with educational value or problem-solving in every hook.

---

#### 3. **Save Rate ↔ CTA Type**

**Hypothesis**: Explicit save CTAs increase save rate.

**How to Track**:
| CTA Type | Example | Avg Save Rate | Lift |
|----------|---------|---------------|------|

| **Link CTA** | "Link in bio" | 1.9% | -59% |
| **No CTA** | None | 2.7% | -41% |

**Finding**: Asking viewers to save your video increases save rate by up to 70% vs. no CTA.

**Action**: Include "Save this for later" in voice-over or on-screen text.

---

#### 4. **Save Rate ↔ Content Format**

**Hypothesis**: Tutorial and list-style content drives higher saves.

**How to Track**:
