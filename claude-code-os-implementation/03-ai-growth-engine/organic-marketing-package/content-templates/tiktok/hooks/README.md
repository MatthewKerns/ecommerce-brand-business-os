# TikTok Content Hooks Library

## What Are Hooks?

**Hooks** are the critical first 1-3 seconds of your TikTok video that determine whether viewers keep watching or scroll away. On TikTok, you have less than one second to capture attention before someone swipes to the next video.

**The Hook's Job**: Stop the scroll. Create curiosity. Make them want to see what happens next.

## Why Hooks Matter

TikTok's algorithm rewards watch time and completion rate. A strong hook:
- **Stops the scroll** - Grabs attention instantly
- **Increases watch time** - More viewers stay to the end
- **Boosts engagement** - Better retention = more likes, comments, shares
- **Gets algorithm love** - Higher completion rates = more reach

**Reality**: Even the best product demo fails without a strong hook. Your first second is everything.

## Hook Formula Framework

Every strong TikTok hook follows one of these proven patterns:

### 1. **Pattern Interrupt**
Break expectations immediately. Do or say something unexpected.
- Example: *"I scratched a $500 Pokemon card... on purpose"*

### 2. **Bold Statement**
Make a claim that demands explanation.
- Example: *"This binder has a lifetime warranty and I'm about to show you why"*

### 3. **Question Hook**
Ask a question that makes your target audience say "yes, me!"
- Example: *"Ever had a cheap binder scratch your favorite card?"*

### 4. **Direct Address**
Call out your specific audience immediately.
- Example: *"If you've ever spent $100+ on a single card, this is for you"*

### 5. **Curiosity Gap**
Tease something interesting without revealing it yet.
- Example: *"I'm about to show you the only binder I trust with my graded cards"*

### 6. **Social Proof**
Lead with a result or achievement.
- Example: *"After scratching three cards with cheap binders, I finally found this"*

## Hook Writing Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- **Keep it short** - 1-3 seconds max
- **Use power words** - "Never," "Always," "Secret," "Mistake"
- **Create curiosity** - Make them need to see what's next
- **Be specific** - "This binder" beats "This product"
- **Match your energy** - Your tone should fit your audience
- **Front-load value** - Lead with the benefit or payoff

### Don'ts ❌
- **Don't bury the hook** - No long intros or setup
- **Don't be vague** - "Check this out" tells them nothing
- **Don't oversell** - Authenticity > hype
- **Don't use filler words** - "So basically" wastes precious seconds
- **Don't copy exactly** - Adapt templates to your voice

## Testing Your Hooks

### A/B Test Your Hooks
Post the same video content with different hooks and track:
- **Watch time** - How long viewers stay
- **Completion rate** - % who watch to the end
- **Engagement rate** - Likes, comments, shares
- **Share rate** - Strongest signal of value

### Winning Hook Indicators
A hook is working when:
- ✅ 50%+ completion rate
- ✅ Above-average comments asking questions
- ✅ Higher shares than usual
- ✅ Strong watch time in first 3 seconds

### Red Flags
Kill or revise hooks that show:
- ❌ Drop-off in first 2 seconds
- ❌ Low completion rate despite good content
- ❌ Confused comments asking "what is this?"
- ❌ Low share rate
