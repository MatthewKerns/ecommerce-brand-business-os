# Product Demo Hooks - TikTok Templates

## Hook Strategy for Product Demos

**Goal**: Stop the scroll and make viewers curious about Infinity Vault binders in the first 1-3 seconds.

**Approach**: Lead with the most visually interesting or emotionally resonant moment. Don't announce what the product is—create curiosity that forces them to keep watching to find out.

**Key Insight**: People don't scroll because they're not interested in binders. They scroll because the first second didn't give them a reason to care. Your hook's job is to make them care before they even know what they're looking at.

## Hook Template 1: The Scratch Test (Pattern Interrupt)

**Category**: Pattern Interrupt

**When to Use**:
- Demonstrating scratch-resistant pages
- Showing product durability
- Differentiating from cheap binders

**Hook**:
```
"I'm about to scratch a [$ amount] [card name] with this binder page..."
```

**Visual**: Camera focused on an expensive card, your hand holding it over the binder page, tension in the moment

**Examples**:
```
"I'm about to scratch a $300 Charizard with this binder page..."

"I'm about to scratch a $500 Pokemon card with this binder page..."

"I'm about to rub a first edition Shadowless Charizard on this binder page..."

"Watch me scratch this $400 card on purpose..."
```

**Why It Works**:
- **Immediate tension** - Collectors instinctively cringe at the thought of scratching expensive cards
- **Pattern interrupt** - Goes against everything collectors know (protect cards at all costs)
- **Curiosity gap** - They HAVE to see what happens next
- **Visual commitment** - You're literally showing the card and the page, making the threat real

**Variations**:
```
"They told me this binder won't scratch cards... so I'm testing it with my most expensive card"

"$400 Pokemon card + binder page = let's see what happens"

"I paid $350 for this card. Now I'm going to drag it across this binder page."

"Every collector's nightmare... I'm about to do it on purpose"
```

**Next Beat** (What comes after the hook):
Show yourself deliberately rubbing the card against the page, then checking the card under light. Reveal that it's still perfect. Explain scratch-resistant pages.

## Hook Template 2: The Collection Reveal (Curiosity Gap)

**Category**: Curiosity Gap

**When to Use**:
- Showing organized collection in binders
- Demonstrating capacity/organization
- Highlighting visual appeal of full binder

**Hook**:
```
"I keep [$ amount] worth of [card type] in this binder..."
```

**Visual**: Close-up of binder exterior or your hand opening it, not showing contents yet

**Examples**:
```
"I keep $10,000 worth of Pokemon cards in this binder..."

"I have $5K in vintage Pokemon sitting in this binder right now..."

"This binder holds my entire $8,000 tournament deck collection..."

"$12,000 worth of graded cards... in this binder..."
```

**Why It Works**:
- **Social proof** - If they trust it with that much value, it must be legit
- **Curiosity** - They want to see what $10K in cards looks like
- **Aspiration** - Target audience relates to protecting valuable collections
- **Immediate credibility** - You're not selling, you're showing what you actually use

**Variations**:
```
"My most valuable cards all live in this one binder..."

"Every card in this binder is worth $100+..."

"I trust this binder with cards I'd never trust to a regular binder..."

"My entire tournament collection fits in here and I'm not worried"
```

**Next Beat** (What comes after the hook):
Open the binder and show pages of organized cards. Point out specific valuable cards. Explain why you trust this binder with your collection.

## Hook Template 3: The Pain Point (Question Hook)

**Category**: Question Hook

**When to Use**:
- Addressing common collector frustrations
- Introducing the product as a solution
- Targeting collectors who've had bad experiences

**Hook**:
```
"Ever had a cheap binder scratch your [$ amount]+ card?"
```

**Visual**: Your face showing empathy/understanding, or a close-up of a scratched card

**Examples**:
```
"Ever had a cheap binder scratch your $100+ card?"

"Has a binder page ever scratched one of your chase cards?"

"Ever pulled an expensive card just to have your binder damage it?"

"You ever organize your collection and realize your binder scratched a card?"
```

**Why It Works**:
- **Immediate identification** - Makes the target audience go "YES, that happened to me"
- **Pain recall** - Reminds them of a frustrating experience
- **Solution teaser** - Implies you have the answer
- **Emotional connection** - Taps into shared collector trauma

**Variations**:
```
"Show of hands: who's had a binder ruin a good card?"

"Cheap binders and expensive cards don't mix... learned that the hard way"

"That moment when you realize your binder scratched your chase card..."

"Why do we spend hundreds on cards then put them in $10 binders?"
```

**Next Beat** (What comes after the hook):
Acknowledge the pain ("Yeah, me too" or "I've seen it happen too many times"). Introduce Infinity Vault as the solution built specifically to prevent this.

## Hook Template 4: The Warranty Flex (Bold Statement)

**Category**: Bold Statement

**When to Use**:
- Emphasizing lifetime warranty
- Highlighting product confidence
- Differentiating from competitors

**Hook**:
```
"This binder has a lifetime warranty and I'm about to show you why"
```

**Visual**: Holding the binder confidently, direct eye contact with camera

**Examples**:
```
"This binder has a lifetime warranty and I'm about to show you why"

"Lifetime warranty on a binder... let me show you why they can promise that"

"They're so confident in this binder they'll replace it forever if anything happens"

"Lifetime warranty. On a binder. Watch this..."
```

**Why It Works**:
- **Credibility signal** - Lifetime warranty = serious product quality
- **Confidence** - The boldness of the claim demands proof
- **Differentiation** - Most binders don't offer this
- **Promise of demonstration** - "I'm about to show you" creates obligation to watch

**Variations**:
```
"No binder company offers a lifetime warranty except these guys..."

"Lifetime warranty on scratch-resistant pages... here's why"

"They'll replace this binder for free. Forever. Here's the catch... there isn't one"

"Why would a binder company offer a lifetime warranty? I was skeptical too..."
```

**Next Beat** (What comes after the hook):
Demonstrate the features that make the warranty possible: scratch-resistant pages, durable construction, quality materials. Show close-ups of build quality.

## Hook Template 5: The Tournament Prep (Direct Address)

**Category**: Direct Address

**When to Use**:
- Targeting competitive players
- Showing tournament-ready organization
- Highlighting portability and protection

**Hook**:
```
"If you play [game] competitively, you need to see this binder..."
```

**Visual**: Tournament setting, deck boxes visible, or competition energy

**Examples**:
```
"If you play Pokemon competitively, you need to see this binder..."

"Tournament players: this is the binder I bring to every event"

"If you've ever brought cards to a tournament, you need this..."

"Competitive players know: your binder matters as much as your deck box"
```

**Why It Works**:
- **Immediate targeting** - Calls out exactly who this is for
- **Authority** - Positions you as someone in that competitive space
- **Necessity language** - "need to see" creates urgency
- **Community signal** - Speaking directly to a specific group

**Variations**:
```
"Tournament players, stop using those cheap binders..."

"If you've ever traded at a tournament, your binder is your first impression"

"Every serious player I know uses one of these binders..."

"Show up to the tournament with this and people notice"
```

**Next Beat** (What comes after the hook):

- Product reveal videos
- Building anticipation

**Hook**:
```
"I've been using [cheap binder brand] for years... just upgraded to this"
```

**Visual**: New Infinity Vault box/packaging in frame, or side-by-side comparison setup

**Examples**:
```
"I've been using Ultra Pro pages for years... just upgraded to this"

"After my third scratched card, I finally bought this binder..."

"Spent $40 on a binder for the first time... let's see if it's worth it"

"Everyone keeps tagging me in posts about this binder... finally got one"
```

**Why It Works**:
- **Relatability** - Many viewers have used the same cheap binders
- **Journey narrative** - They're watching someone upgrade (aspirational)
- **Anticipation** - They want to see what makes it worth upgrading to
- **Social proof** - "Everyone keeps tagging me" implies community endorsement

**Variations**:

"$40 for a binder seemed crazy until I opened it..."

"Let me show you why people are switching to these binders"

"I was skeptical about expensive binders until I got this..."
```

**Next Beat** (What comes after the hook):
Unbox the product, showing packaging quality. Express genuine first impressions. Compare to previous binder if relevant.

*"A product demo without a strong hook is like showing someone your collection when they didn't ask to see it. The hook is what makes them ask."*
