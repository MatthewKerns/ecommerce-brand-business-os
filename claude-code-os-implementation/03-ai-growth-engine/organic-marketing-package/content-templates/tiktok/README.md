## Purpose

This library provides ready-to-use TikTok content templates, hooks, and scripts optimized for e-commerce product content. Built to reduce the learning curve and eliminate guesswork, these templates encapsulate proven patterns that drive saves, engagement, and purchases.

**Core Strategy**: Save-focused content that provides value, gets bookmarked, and drives purchase intent over time.

- Remove the guesswork - know exactly what to say and when
- Accelerate content creation - go from idea to script in minutes
- Enable A/B testing - iterate on what works with data

## Content Strategy Framework

### The Save-Focused Approach

**Goal**: Create content so valuable that viewers save it for later reference.

**Why saves matter**:
- TikTok interprets saves as high-value content
- Saved content gets re-shown to users over time
- Saves correlate with purchase intent
- Algorithmic boost for saved content

**How to maximize saves**:
1. **Lead with value** - Promise actionable information upfront
2. **Dense information** - Pack content viewers want to reference
3. **Practical application** - Show how to use/apply the product
4. **CTA for saves** - "Save this for later" works
5. **Hook promises value** - "You'll want to bookmark this"

### Content Pillars for E-Commerce

| Pillar | Purpose | Save Rate | Example Hook |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Educational** | Teach viewers something valuable | High | "3 things nobody tells you about [product category]" |
| **Problem-Solution** | Show how product solves real pain | High | "If you struggle with [pain point], watch this" |
| **Product Demo** | Display functionality and results | Medium | "Watch what happens when I use [product]" |
| **Social Proof** | Leverage testimonials and popularity | Medium | "This sold out 3 times - here's why" |
| **Entertainment** | Engage through humor or storytelling | Variable | Product-dependent |

### The 3-Second Rule

**Reality**: You have 3 seconds to stop the scroll.

**Hook requirements**:
- ✅ Front-load the value prop
- ✅ Create curiosity gap
- ✅ Promise specific outcome
- ✅ Match viewer intent

**Hook failures**:
- ❌ Slow intros ("Hey guys, welcome back")
- ❌ Generic statements ("Check out this product")
- ❌ No clear value ("This is cool")

## TikTok Best Practices

### Format Specs
- **Length**: 15-60 seconds (sweet spot: 21-34 seconds)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 9:16 vertical video
- **Resolution**: 1080x1920 minimum
- **Framerate**: 30fps minimum, 60fps preferred

### Production Quality
- ✅ Good lighting (natural or ring light)
- ✅ Clear audio (built-in mic usually fine)
- ✅ Stable footage (tripod or prop phone)
- ✅ Authentic feel (raw beats overly polished)
- ❌ Don't over-produce - authenticity wins

### Posting Strategy
- **Frequency**: 3-5 videos per week minimum
- **Best times**: 6-10am, 7-11pm (test for your audience)
- **Consistency**: Post same days/times weekly
- **Batch creation**: Shoot 5-10 videos in one session

### Hashtag Strategy
- **Mix**: 3-5 hashtags total
- **Balance**: 1-2 broad (#FYP, #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt), 2-3 niche (#ToysForKids, #CardCollectors)
- **Avoid**: Spam-looking walls of hashtags
- **Research**: Check what competitors use

### Caption Best Practices
- **Hook first**: Most important text in first line
- **Keep short**: 2-3 sentences max
- **CTA clear**: "Save this," "Link in bio," etc.
- **Readable**: Avoid walls of text

## A/B Testing Framework

**Why test**: Even proven templates need optimization for YOUR specific product and audience.

**What to test**:
- Hook variations (first 3 seconds)
- Video length (15s vs 30s vs 60s)
- CTA placement (early vs late)
- Product focus (features vs benefits)
- Background/setting (in-use vs studio)

**How to test**:
1. Pick ONE variable to test
2. Create two versions (keep everything else identical)
3. Post at similar times on different days
4. Compare save rates and engagement after 72 hours
5. Winner becomes your baseline, test next variable

See `/ab-testing/testing-framework.md` for detailed methodology.

## Performance Tracking

**Track these metrics**:
- **Save rate**: Saves ÷ Views (most important)
- **Engagement rate**: (Likes + Comments + Shares + Saves) ÷ Views
- **Watch time %**: Average watch ÷ Video length
- **Click-through rate**: Profile visits or link clicks ÷ Views
- **Conversion rate**: Purchases ÷ Link clicks

**Success benchmarks** (e-commerce content):
- Save rate: 2-5% is good, 5%+ is excellent
- Engagement rate: 5-10% is good, 10%+ is excellent
- Watch time: 50%+ is good, 70%+ is excellent

**Use the tracker**: Log every video in `/performance-tracking/template-tracker.md` to identify patterns.

## FAQs

### Q: Do I have to follow these templates exactly?
**A**: No. These are frameworks, not scripts. Adapt tone, pacing, and specifics to match your brand. The structure is what matters.

### Q: How many templates should I test before picking a favorite?
**A**: Test 3-5 different hook + script combinations. Post 2-3 videos per combination to account for variance. Then double down on the winner.

### Q: What if none of these templates work for my product?
**A**: Start with the closest fit in `/categories/general-ecommerce.md`. If still struggling, focus on the hook psychology in `/hooks/README.md` and adapt the structure to your needs.

### Q: How often should I switch up templates?
**A**: Once you find a winning combination, use it until performance drops. TikTok rewards consistency. Test new templates weekly, but keep posting your proven winners.

### Q: Can I use these templates for other platforms?
