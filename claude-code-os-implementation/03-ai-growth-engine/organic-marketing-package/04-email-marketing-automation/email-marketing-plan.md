# Email Marketing Automation Plan

## Overview

Turn organic traffic into email subscribers, then nurture them into customers. The funnel: TikTok / Blog → infinitycards.com → Scratch & Win / Spin-to-Win → Email Capture → Automated Sequences → Purchase.

No cold email. Every subscriber opted in because they wanted to scratch a card or spin a wheel. That's warm traffic.

## The Capture Mechanism

### Scratch & Win / Spin-to-Win on infinitycards.com

When visitors land on infinitycards.com (from TikTok CTA, blog, or direct), they hit a gamified email capture:

**Option A: Scratch & Win** (recommended — more on-brand)
- Virtual scratch card experience (ties into TCG card aesthetic)
- "Scratch to reveal your prize"
- Prizes: 10% off, 15% off, 20% off, free shipping, mystery gift
- Requires email to claim prize
- On-brand: feels like opening a pack

**Option B: Spin-to-Win**
- Prize wheel with similar rewards
- Requires email to spin
- More common but still effective

**Prize Distribution**:
| Prize | Probability | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 10% off first order | 40% | Common win, still feels good |
| 15% off first order | 25% | Better deal, creates urgency |
| Free shipping | 20% | Removes friction |
| 20% off first order | 10% | Rare, exciting |
| Mystery bonus gift | 5% | Creates buzz, shareable |

### Capture Form Fields
- Email (required)
- First name (optional but encouraged)
- "What do you collect?" dropdown: Pokemon / Magic / Yu-Gi-Oh / Other (optional, for segmentation)
