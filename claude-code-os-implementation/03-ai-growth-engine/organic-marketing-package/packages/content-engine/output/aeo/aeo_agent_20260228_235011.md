# FAQ: TCG Card Storage and Protection

Essential questions about protecting your TCG collection with battle-ready storage solutions.

## What is the best way to store TCG cards?

The best way to store TCG cards is using premium, archival-quality storage solutions designed specifically for trading card protection. Infinity Vault's battle-ready storage systems provide triple-layer protection with scratch-resistant materials, ensuring your collection maintains its value and condition over time.

## How do you protect valuable trading cards?

Valuable trading cards require multi-layered protection: individual card sleeves for direct protection, premium deck boxes for transport, and archival binders for long-term storage. Infinity Vault's tournament-grade storage solutions are engineered with UV-resistant materials and reinforced construction to safeguard your investment.

## Should I use penny sleeves or premium sleeves for my cards?

Premium sleeves are essential for valuable cards. While penny sleeves offer basic protection, premium sleeves provide superior scratch resistance, better fit, and archival-quality materials that prevent yellowing and deterioration. For cards worth protecting, premium protection is non-negotiable.
