# Deck Building 101: Creating Your First Competitive Deck

Building a competitive deck can seem daunting, but with the right approach, anyone can create a winning strategy.

## Start with a Plan

Every great deck starts with a clear game plan. Ask yourself:
- What is my win condition?
- How quickly can I execute my strategy?
- What are my weaknesses?

## Understanding Mana Curves

A well-constructed mana curve ensures you can play spells consistently throughout the game. Most competitive decks aim for:

- Low CMC spells (1-2 mana): 8-12 cards
- Mid-range spells (3-4 mana): 8-12 cards
- Top-end spells (5+ mana): 4-8 cards

## Card Ratios

A typical 60-card deck should include:
- 24-26 lands
- 34-36 spells
- 4 copies of your best cards
- 3 copies of good situational cards
- 2 copies of silver bullets

## Synergy Over Raw Power

While powerful individual cards are important, synergy between your cards often matters more. Look for cards that work well together and support your overall strategy.

## Testing and Iteration

No deck is perfect on the first try. Playtest extensively and be willing to make changes based on your results.

Happy brewing!
