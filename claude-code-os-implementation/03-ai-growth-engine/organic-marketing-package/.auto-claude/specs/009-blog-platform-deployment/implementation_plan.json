Load gtag.js library from Google Tag Manager\n    2. Initialize GA4 with measurement ID and initial page path\n  - Scripts use \"afterInteractive\" strategy for performance\n  - Proper placement in body tag for optimal loading\n\n**Implementation Features:**\n✅ Environment-based activation via NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID\n✅ Development safety: Skips tracking if ID is placeholder (G-XXXXXXXXXX)\n✅ Server-side rendering safe (typeof window checks throughout)\n✅ Next.js 14 App Router fully compatible\n✅ Optimal performance with afterInteractive loading strategy\n✅ Type-safe implementation with TypeScript global window types\n✅ No console.log/debugging statements (clean production code)\n✅ Follows existing Next.js patterns from project\n✅ Comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all functions\n✅ Error handling for missing/invalid configuration\n\n**Tracking Capabilities:**\n- Automatic pageview tracking on initial load\n- Custom page_path parameter for accurate route tracking\n- Blog post view events with metadata (slug, title, category)\n- Social share tracking across platforms\n- Category filter usage tracking\n- Search query tracking\n- Outbound link click tracking\n- Time-on-page engagement tracking\n- Generic event tracking for future extensibility\n\n**Configuration:**\n- Requires NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID in .env.local\n- Example provided in .env.local.example\n- Gracefully degrades when not configured (no errors)\n- Works in both development and production environments\n\n**Verification:**\nManual verification required:\n1. Set valid GA4 measurement ID in .env.local\n2. Start dev server and open blog in browser\n3. Open Google Analytics Real-Time view\n4. Verify pageview events fire when navigating pages\n5. Check event parameters include page_title and page_location\n6. Test custom events using helper functions in components\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Components can import and use tracking functions:\n  - Import { trackBlogPostView, trackSocialShare } from '@/lib/analytics'\n  - Call functions when user actions occur\n  - Automatic pageview tracking already working via layout\n- Production deployment will activate tracking automatically\n\nGit commit: 9e5fc03\nCommitted to auto-claude/009-blog-platform-deployment branch",
