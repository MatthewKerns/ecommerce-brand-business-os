# Abandoned Cart Recovery

Implement abandoned cart email sequence with proper timing, personalization, and escalating offers to recover lost sales from shoppers who didn't complete checkout.

## Rationale
Abandoned cart is the highest-converting email automation. Integration with TikTok Shop and website carts provides unified recovery capability that siloed tools lack (market gap-1).

## User Stories
- As a shopper, I want a reminder about items I left in cart so that I don't forget to complete my purchase
- As a brand owner, I want to recover lost sales automatically so that I maximize revenue from existing traffic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cart abandonment detection within 30 minutes
- [ ] 3-email recovery sequence (reminder, urgency, offer)
- [ ] Product images and cart contents in emails
- [ ] Direct cart recovery links
- [ ] Recovery rate tracking and reporting
- [ ] Integration with both TikTok Shop and website carts
