# Email Platform Integration (Klaviyo)

Integrate Klaviyo (or alternative) for email marketing with full e-commerce data sync including customer profiles, order history, browse behavior, and segmentation capabilities.

## Rationale
Email is highest-margin revenue channel for e-commerce. Integration into unified system addresses market gap-1 (siloed tools). Using Klaviyo's proven e-commerce capabilities while wrapping it in better experience addresses their pain points.

## User Stories
- As a brand owner, I want all my customer data in one email platform so that I can send targeted campaigns
- As a customer, I want relevant emails based on my interests so that I stay engaged with the brand

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Klaviyo account connected via API
- [ ] Customer profiles syncing from all channels (TikTok, website)
- [ ] Order data flowing for purchase-based segmentation
- [ ] List management with compliance (unsubscribe handling)
- [ ] Basic segments created (new subscribers, customers, VIPs)
