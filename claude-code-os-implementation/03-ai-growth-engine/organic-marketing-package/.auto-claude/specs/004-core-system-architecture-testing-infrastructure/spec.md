# Core System Architecture & Testing Infrastructure

Establish the foundational system architecture including project structure, API design patterns, database schema, CI/CD pipeline, and comprehensive test infrastructure. Create the scaffolding for all subsequent features.

## Rationale
Competitors like GoHighLevel suffer from 'constant glitches' and reliability issues (pain-4-1, pain-4-2). Building proper architecture and testing from the start prevents these issues and builds competitive advantage through reliability.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want clear architecture patterns so that I can build features consistently
- As a user, I expect the system to work reliably without glitches so that I can trust my marketing automation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Monorepo or service structure defined and documented
- [ ] Database schema designed for multi-channel data
- [ ] API design patterns established (REST/GraphQL)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running automated tests on commits
- [ ] Test coverage requirements defined (minimum 70%)
- [ ] Error handling and logging standards implemented
