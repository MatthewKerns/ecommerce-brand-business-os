  "task_description": "# Core System Architecture & Testing Infrastructure\n\nEstablish the foundational system architecture including project structure, API design patterns, database schema, CI/CD pipeline, and comprehensive test infrastructure. Create the scaffolding for all subsequent features.\n\n## Rationale\nCompetitors like GoHighLevel suffer from 'constant glitches' and reliability issues (pain-4-1, pain-4-2). Building proper architecture and testing from the start prevents these issues and builds competitive advantage through reliability.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a developer, I want clear architecture patterns so that I can build features consistently\n- As a user, I expect the system to work reliably without glitches so that I can trust my marketing automation\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Monorepo or service structure defined and documented\n- [ ] Database schema designed for multi-channel data\n- [ ] API design patterns established (REST/GraphQL)\n- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running automated tests on commits\n- [ ] Test coverage requirements defined (minimum 70%)\n- [ ] Error handling and logging standards implemented\n",
