# TikTok Shop API Integration

Build comprehensive TikTok Shop API integration including seller account setup, Content API for video management, Shop API for product/order sync, and Data API for analytics. This is the foundation for all TikTok-related functionality.

## Rationale
TikTok Shop is projected to drive $23.41B in US sales in 2025. This integration is required before any content automation or order fulfillment can work. Addresses market gap-6 for e-commerce-specific TikTok automation.

## User Stories
- As a brand owner, I want my TikTok Shop connected to the system so that I can automate content and track sales
- As the system, I need to sync products and orders from TikTok Shop so that fulfillment can be automated

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TikTok Shop seller account approved with all required documentation
- [ ] TikTok Shop API app approved with Content, Shop, and Data scopes
- [ ] API client library functional for OAuth flow, product sync, and order retrieval
- [ ] Rate limiting and error handling implemented per TikTok API guidelines
