=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: TikTok Content Templates & Best Practices Library
Workspace: tasks/017-tiktok-content-templates-best-practices-library
Started: 2026-02-27

Workflow Type: simple
Rationale: Documentation-only task creating a structured library of TikTok content
templates. No backend services, APIs, or multi-service integration required. Simple
workflow is appropriate for single-location documentation creation.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 7
- Total subtasks: 13
- Created init.sh
- Created project_index.json
- Created context.json

Phase Summary:

Phase 1 - Directory Structure & Master Index: 1 subtask, no dependencies
  - Create master README and directory structure

Phase 2 - Hook Templates Library: 3 subtasks, depends on phase-1-structure
  - Product demo hooks (3+ templates)
  - Problem-solution hooks (3+ templates)
  - Social proof and educational hooks (4+ templates)

Phase 3 - Video Script Frameworks: 3 subtasks, depends on phase-1-structure
  - Unboxing framework
  - Comparison and tutorial frameworks
  - Story-driven and review frameworks

Phase 4 - Category-Specific Templates: 2 subtasks, depends on phase-2-hooks, phase-3-scripts
  - Toys & games category templates
  - General e-commerce category templates

Phase 5 - Performance Tracking Framework: 1 subtask, depends on phase-2-hooks, phase-3-scripts
  - Template performance tracker and save rate analysis

Phase 6 - A/B Testing Framework: 1 subtask, depends on phase-5-tracking
  - A/B testing framework and variant templates

Phase 7 - Customization Workflow: 1 subtask, depends on phase-4-categories
  - Template customization guide

Services Involved:
- documentation: Pure markdown content creation

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: None (sequential documentation task)
- Speedup estimate: Sequential execution appropriate for documentation

Verification Strategy:
- Risk level: trivial
- Skip validation: true (documentation-only)
- Acceptance criteria:
  * Master README exists and links to all sections
  * 10+ hook templates created across 4 categories
  * 5+ complete video script frameworks with timing and structure
  * Category-specific templates for toys & games and general e-commerce
  * Performance tracking framework with save rate correlation
  * A/B testing framework with variant examples
  * Customization workflow guide created

Files to Create:
- Master README
- 4 hook template files (product-demos, problem-solution, social-proof, educational)
- 5 script framework files (unboxing, comparison, tutorial, story-driven, review)
- 2 category template files (toys-and-games, general-ecommerce)
- 2 performance tracking files (template-tracker, save-rate-analysis)
- 2 A/B testing files (testing-framework, variant-templates)
- 1 customization guide (how-to-customize)
- Supporting README files for each directory

Total: ~19 markdown files

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

This is a documentation-only task. No services need to be started.

To continue building this spec, a coder agent will:
1. Read implementation_plan.json
2. Find the next pending subtask
3. Create the markdown documentation files
4. Verify file creation
5. Mark subtasks as complete

No environment setup or service startup required.
