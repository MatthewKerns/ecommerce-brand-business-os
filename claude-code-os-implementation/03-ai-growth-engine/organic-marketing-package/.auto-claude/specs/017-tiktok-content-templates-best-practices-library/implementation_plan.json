Variant templates includes: 20 ready-to-use test scenarios organized by element type (Hook Variants: Tests 1-5, Script Structure Variants: Tests 6-10, CTA Variants: Tests 11-15, Visual Style Variants: Tests 16-18, Caption/Hashtag Variants: Tests 19-20). Each test provides side-by-side Variant A (Control) vs Variant B (Test) comparisons with hypothesis, primary metric, expected winner, and key differences. Also includes testing scenarios by content goal (maximize saves, follows, link clicks, engagement), custom variant creation template, and pro tips. Both files follow the established pattern from template-tracker.md with clear structure, data-driven frameworks, actionable guidance, and practical examples. All verification requirements met: testing-framework.md includes comprehensive A/B test methodology, variant-templates.md provides extensive hook/script/CTA variant examples for immediate testing.",
