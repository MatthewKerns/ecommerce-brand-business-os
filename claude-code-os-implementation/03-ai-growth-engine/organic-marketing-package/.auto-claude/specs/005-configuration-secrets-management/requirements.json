  "task_description": "# Configuration & Secrets Management\n\nEstablish secure configuration management for API keys, OAuth tokens, environment settings, and deployment configurations. Support development, staging, and production environments.\n\n## Rationale\nRequired infrastructure for any production system handling sensitive API credentials. Addresses technical debt identified in discovery about undefined configuration approach.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a developer, I want secure configuration management so that I can deploy safely without exposing credentials\n- As the system, I need automatic token refresh so that API integrations don't break unexpectedly\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Secrets stored securely (not in code repository)\n- [ ] Environment-specific configuration files working\n- [ ] API token refresh handled automatically\n- [ ] Configuration documented for onboarding new services\n- [ ] Encryption at rest for sensitive credentials\n",
