  "task_description": "# Unified Analytics Data Pipeline\n\nBuild data pipeline aggregating analytics from all channels (TikTok, website, email, sales) into unified data warehouse. Enable cross-channel attribution and full-funnel analysis.\n\n## Rationale\nDirectly addresses market gap-4 (no clear ROI tracking for organic marketing). Competitors track engagement metrics, not revenue attribution. This is a core differentiator enabling proof of organic marketing value.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a brand owner, I want all my marketing data in one place so that I can see the full picture\n- As a marketer, I want to track the customer journey so that I know which channels drive sales\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] TikTok data flowing (views, saves, shares, shop clicks)\n- [ ] Website analytics connected (GA4 or equivalent)\n- [ ] Email metrics syncing (opens, clicks, conversions)\n- [ ] Sales data from TikTok Shop and website\n- [ ] Customer journey tracking across touchpoints\n- [ ] Data refresh at least daily\n",
