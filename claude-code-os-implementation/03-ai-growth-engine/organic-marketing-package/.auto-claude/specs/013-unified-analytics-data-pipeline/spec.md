# Unified Analytics Data Pipeline

Build data pipeline aggregating analytics from all channels (TikTok, website, email, sales) into unified data warehouse. Enable cross-channel attribution and full-funnel analysis.

## Rationale
Directly addresses market gap-4 (no clear ROI tracking for organic marketing). Competitors track engagement metrics, not revenue attribution. This is a core differentiator enabling proof of organic marketing value.

## User Stories
- As a brand owner, I want all my marketing data in one place so that I can see the full picture
- As a marketer, I want to track the customer journey so that I know which channels drive sales

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TikTok data flowing (views, saves, shares, shop clicks)
- [ ] Website analytics connected (GA4 or equivalent)
- [ ] Email metrics syncing (opens, clicks, conversions)
- [ ] Sales data from TikTok Shop and website
- [ ] Customer journey tracking across touchpoints
- [ ] Data refresh at least daily
