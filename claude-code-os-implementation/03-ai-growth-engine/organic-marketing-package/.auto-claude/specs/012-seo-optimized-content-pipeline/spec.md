# SEO-Optimized Content Pipeline

Build automated pipeline for creating and publishing SEO-optimized blog content. Include keyword research integration, on-page SEO checklist enforcement, internal linking, and content scheduling.

## Rationale
Addresses market gap-1 (siloed tools) by integrating SEO content into the unified system rather than requiring separate SEO tools. Automation reduces manual work per competitor pain points about time-consuming workflows (pain-2-6).

## User Stories
- As a brand owner, I want SEO-optimized content automatically so that articles rank without manual optimization expertise
- As a content creator, I want SEO guidance so that I know what to include for ranking

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Keyword research workflow with target keyword assignment per article
- [ ] On-page SEO checklist (title, meta, headings, image alt, internal links)
- [ ] Automated internal linking suggestions based on content relevance
- [ ] Content scheduling integrated with blog CMS
- [ ] SEO score/grade for each article before publishing
- [ ] Integration with AI content agent for draft generation
