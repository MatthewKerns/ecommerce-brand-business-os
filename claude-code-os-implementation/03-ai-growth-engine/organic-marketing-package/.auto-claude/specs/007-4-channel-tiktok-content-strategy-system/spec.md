# 4-Channel TikTok Content Strategy System

Implement the 4 elemental TikTok channel strategy (Air, Water, Fire, Earth) with distinct content themes, posting schedules, and audience targeting for each channel. Build channel management infrastructure.

## Rationale
Unique content strategy that differentiates from competitors' generic social posting (addresses market gap-6). The 4-channel approach maximizes reach while testing different content angles. Focus on 'saves' metric aligns with algorithm and purchase behavior.

## User Stories
- As a brand owner, I want multiple themed TikTok channels so that I can test different content approaches and reach wider audiences
- As a content creator, I want clear channel guidelines so that I know what content goes where

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 4 TikTok channels created with consistent branding per element theme
- [ ] Content calendar system with channel-specific scheduling
- [ ] Channel performance tracking with save rate as primary metric
- [ ] Content categorization by element/theme
- [ ] Cross-posting rules to prevent content duplication penalties
