  "task_description": "# TikTok Content Scheduling & Auto-Publishing\n\nBuild reliable TikTok content scheduling with automatic publishing, retry mechanisms, failure notifications, and publish confirmation. Support all TikTok content types including standard videos and shop-linked posts.\n\n## Rationale\nDirectly addresses Hootsuite pain-1-3 (scheduled posts failing without notification) and Later pain-5-1 (posts freeze/fail, users spend same time as manual posting). Reliability is a key differentiator.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a brand owner, I want to schedule content in advance so that I can batch my work and maintain consistent posting\n- As a brand owner, I want immediate notification if posts fail so that I can fix issues before they impact my strategy\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Content queued and published at scheduled times with 99%+ reliability\n- [ ] Failed posts trigger immediate notification with clear error reason\n- [ ] Automatic retry logic for transient failures\n- [ ] Publish confirmation stored with TikTok video ID\n- [ ] Support for TikTok Shop product tagging in videos\n- [ ] Bulk scheduling capability for content batches\n",
