# Amazon SP-API MCF Integration

Build Amazon Selling Partner API integration focused on Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) capabilities. Enable order creation, shipment tracking, and inventory management through Amazon's proven fulfillment infrastructure.

## Rationale

- As the system, I need to create MCF orders and track shipments so customers receive timely delivery updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Amazon Seller Central account configured with FBA inventory
- [ ] SP-API app approved with Fulfillment scope
- [ ] MCF order creation working with proper address formatting
- [ ] Shipment tracking numbers retrievable and sync-able
- [ ] Inventory levels queryable for stock management
