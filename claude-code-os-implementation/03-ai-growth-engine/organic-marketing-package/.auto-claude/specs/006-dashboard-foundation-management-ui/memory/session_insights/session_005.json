        "file": "dashboard/.prettierrc",
        "changes": "Created new Prettier configuration file with 10 formatting rules",
        "impact": "Establishes consistent code formatting standards including semicolons, trailing commas, 80-char line width, 2-space indentation, and Tailwind CSS plugin integration"

        "changes": "Added 7 new strict mode compiler options after paths configuration",

      "Comprehensive linting and formatting setup following Next.js best practices",
      "Three-layer quality assurance: TypeScript strict compilation, ESLint rules, Prettier formatting",

    "gotchas_discovered": [
      "Comments used in tsconfig.json (// style) despite JSON format - may cause parsing issues in strict JSON parsers",
      "Prettier-plugin-tailwindcss included but Tailwind CSS configuration setup not verified in this session",
      "console.log forbidden while console.warn and console.error permitted - asymmetric console handling"

    "approach_outcome": "Successfully established a comprehensive developer experience setup combining TypeScript strict mode, ESLint rule enforcement, and Prettier code formatting. All five configuration files modified in single coordinated commit. Setup includes proper exclusion patterns and integration with Tailwind CSS.",

      "Validate tsconfig.json in strict JSON parser - remove comments or use alternative documentation approach",
      "Add pre-commit hooks (husky) to enforce format and lint checks before commits",
      "Document the underscore-prefixed variable convention in project guidelines",
      "Consider adding ESLint rules for import sorting and file organization",
      "Test Prettier-Tailwind plugin integration to ensure CSS class ordering works as expected",
      "Add .vscode/settings.json to enable format-on-save for consistent developer experience"
