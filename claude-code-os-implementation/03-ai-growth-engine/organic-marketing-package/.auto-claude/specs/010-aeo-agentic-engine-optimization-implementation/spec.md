# AEO (Agentic Engine Optimization) Implementation

Implement comprehensive AEO strategy to get brand recommended by AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity). Include structured data markup, FAQ schema, clear definitive answers, and AI-citation optimization.

## Rationale
Addresses the highest-opportunity market gap-2. No existing tools optimize for AI assistants, yet Gartner predicts 25% drop in traditional search by 2026. First-mover advantage in AEO space is a key differentiator.

## User Stories
- As a brand owner, I want AI assistants to recommend my products so that I capture the next generation of shoppers
- As a potential customer, I want to find relevant products when I ask AI assistants for recommendations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FAQ schema markup implemented on all product and content pages
- [ ] Product schema with complete attributes for AI parsing
- [ ] Content structured with clear, definitive answers to common questions
- [ ] AI assistant testing workflow (query ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity)
- [ ] 60% citation rate target tracked and measured
- [ ] AEO checklist integrated into content creation workflow
