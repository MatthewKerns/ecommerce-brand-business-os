## Brand Strategy Integration

Every piece of content must pass through the brand filter:

### Pre-Publish Checklist
- [ ] Does this use brand voice? (Confident, passionate, empowering, direct)
- [ ] Does it use brand language? (Battle-ready, equipment, gear, arsenal — NOT storage, box, container)
- [ ] Does it connect to a content pillar?
- [ ] Does it make the viewer feel like a serious player?
- [ ] Does the CTA direct to infinitycards.com or TikTok Shop?
- [ ] Is the hook in the first 0.5-1 second?

### Brand Voice Per Channel
| Channel | Voice Emphasis |
|---------|---------------|
| Air | Authoritative + Helpful (the wise mentor) |
| Water | Aspirational + Satisfying (the experience) |
| Fire | Intense + Confident (the competitor) |
| Earth | Warm + Authentic (the community member) |

## Key Metrics to Track

### Primary Metric: SAVES
Saves indicate high-intent engagement. Someone saves because:
- They want to buy later
- They want to learn/reference later
- They want to share with someone

**Save Rate Target**: 3-5% of views (industry benchmark: 1-2%)
