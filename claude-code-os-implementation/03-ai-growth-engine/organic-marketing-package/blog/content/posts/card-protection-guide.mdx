# Protecting Your Investment: A Guide to Card Care

Your Magic: The Gathering collection represents both a financial investment and countless hours of gameplay. Proper care ensures your cards maintain their value and remain playable for years to come.

## Essential Protection Supplies

Every collector needs:

1. **Sleeves**: The first line of defense against wear and tear
2. **Deck Boxes**: Protect sleeved decks during transport
3. **Binders**: Organized storage for your collection
4. **Top Loaders**: Hard plastic cases for valuable singles

## Sleeve Types Explained

### Standard Sleeves
Perfect for everyday play, standard sleeves offer basic protection against shuffling wear and spills.

### Double Sleeving
For valuable cards, use both an inner perfect-fit sleeve and an outer standard sleeve. This provides maximum protection against damage.

### Premium Sleeves
Higher-quality sleeves offer better durability and shuffle feel, making them ideal for tournament play.

## Storage Best Practices

- Keep cards away from direct sunlight
- Maintain consistent temperature and humidity
- Store vertically to prevent warping
- Use desiccant packets in storage containers

## Handling Tips

- Always handle cards by the edges
- Wash hands before handling valuable cards
- Avoid eating or drinking while playing
- Use playmats to protect cards during games

## When to Replace Sleeves

Replace sleeves when you notice:
- Splits or tears
- Significant wear on corners
- Dirt buildup that won't clean off
- Marked patterns from damage

Investing in proper card protection now will save you money and heartache in the long run!
