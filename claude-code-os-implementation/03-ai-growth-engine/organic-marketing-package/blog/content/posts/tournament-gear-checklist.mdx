# Tournament Day Gear Checklist: Never Show Up Unprepared

You've playtested for weeks. Your deck is tuned. Your sideboard is perfect. Then you arrive at the tournament and realize you forgot your dice. Don't let gear failures cost you wins.

## The Night Before: Pre-Tournament Prep

Winners prepare before tournament day. Set everything out the night before:

### Deck Essentials
- Main deck (sleeved and counted)
- Sideboard (in separate, labeled storage)
- Deck box with secure closure
- Backup sleeves (minimum 10)
- Deck list (printed, filled out, verified)

### Gameplay Tools
- Dice and counters
- Life tracker (app or pen/paper backup)
- Playmat
- Tokens for your deck's mechanics

Count your cards. Check your sleeves. Verify your decklist matches your actual deck. These three minutes of preparation prevent devastating tournament losses.

## Day-Of Essentials

Your tournament bag should always include:

### Core Gear
- **Water bottle**: Hydration affects decision-making
- **Snacks**: Energy-dense, non-messy options
- **Phone charger**: Dead batteries mean missed pairings
- **Pen and paper**: For life totals and notes

### Protection Equipment
- Hand sanitizer
- Wet wipes (for cleanup, not for cards)
- Small towel or cloth
- Extra sleeves in original packaging

Tournament venues are unpredictable. Spills happen. Cards get damaged. Prepare for the unexpected.

## The Competitive Edge

Serious competitors bring gear most players forget:

### Strategic Tools
- **Small notebook**: Track meta, matchup notes, sideboard changes
- **Calculator**: For complex life total situations
- **Extra tokens**: Help opponents who forgot theirs (good karma)
- **Proxy cards**: For reference during deck construction events

### Comfort Items
- **Hoodie or jacket**: Tournament halls run cold
- **Headache medicine**: Tournaments are long
- **Breath mints**: Your opponents will appreciate it
- **Extra phone charger**: Be the hero who saves someone's tournament

## The Final Check

Before you leave for the tournament, verify:

1. ✓ Deck and sideboard counted and verified
2. ✓ Deck list completed and signed
3. ✓ All essential gear packed
4. ✓ Water and snacks ready
5. ✓ Phone charged and tournament app installed
6. ✓ Directions and parking researched
7. ✓ Backup sleeves packed
8. ✓ Payment method ready (cash + card)

## Tournament Day Mistakes to Avoid

Don't be that player who:
- Shows up with a damaged deck box
- Borrows dice every round
- Asks for sleeves mid-tournament
- Forgets their deck list
- Runs out of water by round 3

Your gear preparation is part of your competitive strategy. Treat it seriously.

## The Winner's Mindset

Professional players know: tournament success starts before you shuffle up. Your gear, your preparation, your readiness—these factors separate champions from participants.

Pack smart. Prepare thoroughly. Show up ready to win.

Your opponents will prepare their decks. Will they prepare their gear? That's your edge.
