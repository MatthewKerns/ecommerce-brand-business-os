# EARTH Channel — Community & Stories

> *"Grounded in community"*

---

## Channel Identity

Earth is the channel of **belonging, nostalgia, and authentic human connection**. When someone watches an Earth video, they should feel a pull in their chest — the memory of their first pack, the warmth of their local game store, the pride of showing their collection to someone who truly gets it.

Earth doesn't teach. Earth doesn't sell. Earth doesn't hype. Earth **connects**.

The emotional frequency is **warm authenticity**. You're the person who remembers what it felt like to open your first booster pack. You're the regular at your LGS who knows everyone by name. You're the collector who values the stories behind the cards more than their market price.

## The Earth Chat Agent

### Persona: The Community Elder

The Earth chat agent speaks from a place of deep belonging. It values people over products, stories over statistics, community over competition. It's the voice that reminds you why you started collecting in the first place.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Warm, genuine, unhurried
- Uses phrases like "Tell me more about that..." and "There's a story here..." and "Your community needs to hear this"
- Asks connecting questions: "What's the first card that meant something to you?"
- Thinks in narratives: every piece of content is someone's story
- References community moments, shared experiences, nostalgic touchpoints

**Opening interactions (examples):**
- "Someone in r/PokemonTCG just posted about finding their childhood collection in their parents' attic. 4,000 upvotes. The comments are pure gold — everyone sharing their own story. This is Earth content waiting to happen."
- "Your 'how I started collecting' video from last week has the longest average watch time of any channel this month. People watched the whole thing. That's Earth doing what Earth does."
- "There's a local game store anniversary this weekend. Have you thought about featuring LGS stories? The community loves seeing their spaces celebrated."

**Dedicated workflows the agent offers:**
1. **Story Mining** — "Let's find the stories worth telling. What's happening in your community right now?" Identify narrative content from community signals
2. **Nostalgia Builder** — "What era, what moment, what memory resonates with your audience? Let's build content around that feeling"
3. **Community Spotlight Planner** — "Who in your community deserves to be featured? Let's plan a spotlight series"
4. **LGS Feature Builder** — "Which local game stores should we celebrate? Let me help you build the story around them"
5. **Origin Story Workshop** — "Every collector has an origin story. Let's help your audience share theirs. What format works best?"

## Visual Theme & UI

When you enter the Earth workspace, the interface grounds you:

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Rich earth tones — warm browns, deep greens, terracotta
- **Accent**: Moss green, amber gold, clay orange
- **Background**: Deep forest green to warm brown gradient, like fertile soil under a canopy
- **Text**: Cream whites and warm golds for organic warmth

### Visual Cues
- Subtle growth animations — content cards that feel planted, rooted
- Rounded, organic shapes — no sharp edges, everything feels natural
- Texture: Subtle grain or paper-like quality to surfaces
- Typography: Warm serif or rounded sans-serif — approachable, like a handwritten note from a friend

### Ambient Elements
- A textured, earthy background with subtle depth (layered greens and browns)
- The chat agent icon is an Earth-themed symbol — a mountain, a tree, a rooted glyph
- Content cards sit with weight — they feel grounded, stable, substantial
- Transitions are gentle — dissolves and soft movements, nothing jarring

## Metrics That Matter for Earth

|--------|--------|-----|
| **Average watch time** | 85%+ | Story content must hold attention through the emotional arc — people watch stories to the end |
| **Comment quality** | Personal stories in comments | The goal is comments like "This reminds me of when I..." — stories beget stories |

| **Follow rate** | 3-4% (highest of all channels) | Earth builds the deepest follower loyalty because it builds emotional connection |

### What Success Looks Like
A successful Earth video makes someone **feel seen and connected**. They comment with their own story because yours made them feel safe to share. They follow because this channel feels like their community. They share because they want their friends to feel what they just felt.

## Product Integration (Subtle — 1 in 5 Videos)

Earth is the **least product-forward channel**. Products only appear when they're genuinely part of the story being told.

**How products appear in Earth content:**
- "This binder holds my collection from when I was 12" — product as a vessel for memory
- Products visible in LGS spotlights and community event coverage (natural placement)
- "How I protect the cards that mean the most to me" — emotional framing
- Product appears in story context, never as the focus

**The rule:** In Earth content, if you remove the product and the story still works, you've done it right. The product is a supporting character, never the protagonist. The community is always the star.

## Posting Schedule

| Day | Time (ET) | Content Type |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| Monday | 6:00 PM | Origin Story or Nostalgia Hit |
| Wednesday | 6:00 PM | Community Spotlight or LGS Feature |
| Saturday | 3:00 PM | Real Talk or Community Story |
| Sunday | 3:00 PM | Weekend Community Recap or Nostalgic Moment |

**4 posts per week** — fewer than other channels because each piece needs to carry genuine emotional weight. Quality and authenticity over volume.

## Brand Pillar Alignment

Earth primarily serves two brand pillars:

1. **Community Champion** — celebrating the people, places, and stories that make the TCG community what it is
2. **Collector's Journey** — honoring the personal journey of every collector, from first pack to prized collection

The Earth channel is where Infinity Vault builds **loyalty**. Air makes people trust you. Water makes people want your products. Fire makes people feel competitive identity. Earth makes people feel like **they belong**. And belonging is the deepest form of brand loyalty there is. When someone feels like Infinity Vault is their community's brand — not just a product company, but a brand that gets them — they become a customer for life.
