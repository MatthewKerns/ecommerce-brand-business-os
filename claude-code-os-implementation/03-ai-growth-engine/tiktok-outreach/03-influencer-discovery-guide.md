## Method 3: Competitor Product Mentions

Search for creators who have already reviewed or mentioned competitor products:

| Search Term | What You'll Find |
|-------------|-----------------|
| "card binder review" | Creators who review binder products |
| "best card binder" | Recommendation/comparison videos |
| "topdeck binder" | Creators who use our competitor |
| "vault x binder" | Another competitor's audience |
| "ultra pro binder review" | Budget competitor audience |
| "card binder haul" | Creators who buy multiple binders |

**Why This Works**: These creators have already demonstrated willingness to feature card storage products. They have an audience interested in these products.

---

## Method 4: Comment Section Mining

High-engagement videos about card storage often have comments like:
- "What binder is that?"
- "Where did you get that binder?"
- "I need a better binder for my collection"

**Process**:
1. Find popular card collection/organization videos
2. Read through comments for users asking about binders
3. Check if any commenters are also creators (click profile)
4. Some commenters may be micro-influencers who would love free product
