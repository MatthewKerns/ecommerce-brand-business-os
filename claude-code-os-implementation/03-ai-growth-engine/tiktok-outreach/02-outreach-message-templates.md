# TikTok Influencer Outreach Message Templates

## Outreach Strategy

**Goal**: Build genuine relationships with TCG/gaming creators on TikTok to drive product awareness and sales through authentic content.

**Approach**: Personalization-first. Every message references specific content the creator has made. Generic mass messages get ignored. Thoughtful, specific outreach gets responses.

---

## Message Framework

Every outreach message follows this structure:

```
1. PERSONAL HOOK     - Reference their specific content (proves you watched)
2. WHO WE ARE        - Brief, confident brand intro (not salesy)
3. WHY THEM          - What about their content made us reach out
4. THE ASK           - Clear, low-pressure collaboration offer
5. VALUE FOR THEM    - What they get (product, commission, exposure)
6. EASY NEXT STEP    - Simple response path
```
