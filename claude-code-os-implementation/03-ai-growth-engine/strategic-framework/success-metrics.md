## Level 1: North Star Metric

### Primary OBG Metric
- **Metric**: Contribution Margin 3 (CM3%)
- **Definition**: Revenue - COGS - Amazon Fees - Advertising - Shipping
- **Current Value**: Negative/Break-even
- **Target Value**: Consistent positive margin (15%+ CM3%)
- **Target Date**: Q4 2026
- **Progress**: ____%

### Why CM3%?
CM3% is the true measure of Amazon profitability. It accounts for:
- Product cost
- Amazon referral fees
- FBA fees
- Advertising spend
- Returns and adjustments

A positive CM3% means the business is self-sustaining.

## Key Formulas

### CM3% Calculation
```
CM3% = (Revenue - COGS - Amazon Fees - Ad Spend - Shipping) / Revenue × 100
```

### Break-even Price
```
Break-even = (COGS + Amazon Fees + Target Ad Spend) / (1 - Return Rate)
Infinity Vault Break-even: $15.19
```

### ACoS vs TACoS
```
ACoS = Ad Spend / Ad Revenue × 100
TACoS = Ad Spend / Total Revenue × 100
```

### R&D Velocity
```
Validated Products / Quarter = Ideas × Screen Rate × Validation Rate × Viability Rate
Target: 100 × 10% × 50% × 50% = 2.5 products/quarter
```

---

## Metric-Driven Decisions

### When CTR Drops
```
CTR drops → Check main image test → Review competitor changes → Adjust image/title
```

### When CVR Drops
```
CVR drops → Check price competitiveness → Review listing content → Check reviews
```

### When CM3% Negative
```
CM3% negative → Reduce ACoS → Adjust pricing → Cut unprofitable SKUs
```

### When R&D Behind
```
R&D hours low → Clear calendar → Block time → Accountability check-in
```
