# One Big Obsessional Goal (OBG)

## The Concept
Your OBG is the single overriding objective that everything else serves. It's the answer to: "If I could only accomplish ONE thing in the next 12 months, what would have the biggest impact?"

---

## Current OBG

### Statement
> **"Turn Infinity Vault profitable within the next 12 months"**

This means achieving consistent positive contribution margin (CM3%) across all products while building a sustainable product pipeline for long-term growth.

### Timeframe
- **Start Date**: Q4 2025
- **End Date**: Q4 2026
- **Duration**: 12 months
- **90-Day Sprint**: Q4 2025 (Current Focus)

### Why This Goal?
- **Impact**: Resolves critical cash flow challenges and validates the entire business model
- **Leverage**: Profitability enables reinvestment in new products, creating a growth flywheel
- **Passion**: Transforms a struggling inventory situation into a scalable e-commerce business

## Supporting Pillars

### Pillar 1: Aggressive Optimization of Current Assets
- **What**: Maximize revenue and margin from existing inventory through listing optimization, price testing, and PPC refinement
- **Development Plan**:
  - Main image A/B testing (Lifetime Warranty badge, compositions)
  - Title optimization (move "Two Pack" to front)
  - Strategic price testing (break-even test, then premium validation)
  - Targeted PPC campaigns (SBV, Product Targeting)
- **Current Status**: In execution
- **Success Criteria**: "Win the sale from the search results"

### Pillar 2: Systematic Product Research & Development
- **What**: Build a disciplined R&D engine for predictable growth through new product launches
- **Development Plan**:
  - Generate 100+ product ideas
  - Screen to 5-10 validated concepts
  - One net new product launch-ready
  - Focus on Pokemon-themed designs (high search volume)
- **Current Status**: 3 hours/day dedicated (80-100 hours/quarter)
- **Success Criteria**: One validated product with confirmed supplier and launch plan

## OBG Alignment Framework

### Does It Serve the OBG?
For any task/project/opportunity, ask:

1. **Direct Impact** (0-100%)
   - Does this improve CTR, CVR, or CM3%?
   - Does this advance the new product pipeline?
   - Can you trace a clear line to profitability?

2. **Time Investment**
   - Is this the best use of time toward profitability?
   - Does this fall under Pillar 1 or Pillar 2?

3. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Does ROI justify the investment?
   - Roger Vi principle: "It is better to have no sale than negative margin sale with no ranking benefit"

### Scoring Guide
- **90-100%**: Critical path - Must do NOW (listing tests, price changes, validated R&D)
- **70-89%**: Important - Schedule this week (PPC refinement, supplier outreach)
- **50-69%**: Useful - Add to backlog (branding improvements, content refresh)
- **<50%**: Misaligned - Don't do (new features without validation, speculative opportunities)

---

## OBG Protection

### What to Say NO To
- New product ideas that aren't thoroughly validated
- Advertising spend that doesn't generate ranking benefit or profit
- Feature additions that don't improve CTR/CVR
- Opportunities outside the Amazon marketplace (for now)
- "Good" ideas that distract from the two pillars

### Kill List
Things explicitly rejected to protect OBG focus:
1. Launching products without full validation process
2. Running broad PPC campaigns with no ROI tracking
3. Price points in the "no man's land" (neither value leader nor premium)
4. Guesswork optimization - all changes must be tested

---

## Weekly OBG Review

### Questions to Ask
1. What listing optimization tests were completed?
2. What did the data reveal about CTR/CVR/BSR?
3. How many hours went into R&D this week? (Target: 21 hours)
4. What's the single most impactful action for next week?

*"One obsession. One goal. One direction. Everything else is distraction."*

**For Infinity Vault: Every action either improves margins on current products or advances a validated new product. Nothing else matters until profitability is achieved.**
