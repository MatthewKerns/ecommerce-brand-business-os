## Customer Avatars

### Avatar 1: "Collector Chris" (Primary)

**Demographics**: 28-year-old male, software developer, $75K income

**Story**:
> Chris started collecting Pokemon cards during the pandemic boom. What began as nostalgia turned into a serious hobby. He's invested $2,000+ in his collection and realizes he needs proper storage. His first cheap binders started scratching cards, and he's now looking for premium protection without the premium price tag.

**A Day in Their Life**:
- Morning: Checks Pokemon news/releases while commuting
- Workday: Occasional Reddit browsing during breaks
- Evening: Opens new packs, organizes collection
- Weekend: Trades with friends, visits local card shop

**Struggles**:
1. Previous binders scratched his cards
2. Premium binders seem overpriced
3. Growing collection needs multiple binders

**What Makes Him Buy**:
- Sees "scratch-resistant" in listing
- Two-pack offers better value
- Reviews mention durability
- Lifetime warranty removes risk
