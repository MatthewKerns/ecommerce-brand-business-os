## Decision Types & Approaches

### Type 1: Reversible Decisions
*Two-way doors - easy to undo*

**Approach**: Decide quickly, iterate
- Time limit: 1 hour max analysis
- Bias: Action over analysis
- Review: Quick check after execution

### Type 2: Irreversible Decisions
*One-way doors - hard to undo*

**Approach**: Analyze thoroughly, commit fully
- Time investment: Whatever is needed
- Bias: Careful consideration
- Review: Full framework application

### Type 3: High Stakes Decisions
*Significant impact on OBG*

**Approach**: Maximum rigor
- Use full framework
- Seek external input
- Sleep on it before finalizing

### Type 4: Low Stakes Decisions
*Minimal impact either way*
