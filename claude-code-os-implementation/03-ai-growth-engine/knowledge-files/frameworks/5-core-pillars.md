## The 5 Pillars at a Glance

| Pillar | Focus | Key Question |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| 1. New Product Development | Pipeline of future products | Do we have a 12-month product roadmap? |
| 2. Launching New Products | Launch system & execution | Can we predictably achieve KW rank, sales, reviews? |
| 3. SKU Optimization | Maximize current catalog | Are all SKUs at peak profitability? |
| 4. Amazon Advertising (PPC) | Profitable paid traffic | Is TACoS at target for all SKUs? |
| 5. Audience Utilization | Owned customer list | Are we using our list for ideas, launches, re-sells? |

---

## Pillar 1: New Product Development

### What It Is
The ongoing process of consistently finding, validating, and preparing new products to add to your catalog. Creating a pipeline of future opportunities.

### Why It's Crucial
- Primary engine for revenue growth
- Without a pipeline, business stagnates
- Turns growth from luck into a predictable outcome

### Maturity Levels

| Score | Level | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | Beginning | "We do not have a list of product ideas to develop in the next 12 months nor do we know how many products we should launch to meet our revenue goals." |
| 2 | Early | Some ideas documented but not validated |
| 3 | Developing | "Our product ideas are being validated with suppliers and samples are being produced, but we haven't placed any new product orders yet." |
| 4 | Advanced | Products in production, pipeline documented |
| 5 | Mastered | "We have products in production now, ready to produce later this quarter, and a list of more product ideas to be used in 6-12 months time." |

### Key Success Metrics
- Number of validated product ideas in pipeline
- Products in production
- Products launching next quarter
- 12-month product roadmap exists

### Infinity Vault Context
**Current Focus**: Pillar 2 of OBG (Systematic Product R&D)
- Target: 100 ideas → 10 screened → 3 validated → 1 launch-ready
- Time investment: 3 hrs/day, 21 hrs/week, 84 hrs/month

---

## Pillar 2: Launching New Products

### What It Is
The strategic, repeatable process of bringing a new item to market with the goal of achieving sustainable sales, high keyword ranking, and steady positive reviews.

### Why It's Crucial
- A poor launch can kill a great product
- First impressions matter for algorithm
- Need documented launch system, not heroic efforts

### Maturity Levels

| Score | Level | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | Beginning | "We are not launching any products right now." |
| 2 | Early | Occasional launches with inconsistent results |
| 3 | Developing | "Some product launches are sustaining KW rank, sales, and review velocity/ratings, but the results are inconsistent." |
| 4 | Advanced | Most launches successful, documented process |
| 5 | Mastered | "We are launching products every month/quarter and are predictably sustaining KW rank, sales, and review velocity/ratings." |

### Key Success Metrics
- Launch success rate
- Time to sustainable KW rank
- Review velocity post-launch
- Sales stability 30/60/90 days post-launch

### Infinity Vault Context
- Per Launch training: Binders may need relaunch approach
- Document launch process for future products
- Build repeatable launch checklist

---

## Pillar 3: SKU Optimization

### What It Is
The ongoing management of your existing product catalog to ensure each item is performing at its peak potential. Analyzing revenue, managing profitability, making strategic decisions.

### Why It's Crucial
- Maximizes profit from assets you already own
- Prevents stockouts
- Improves underperformers
- Doubles down on winners

> "Every day you neglect SKU optimization, you are leaving money on the table."

### Maturity Levels

| Score | Level | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | Beginning | "Our SKUs keep running out of stock and/or are losing money. We're unable to see good results trying to improve revenue/profitability." |
| 2 | Early | Some awareness of issues but no system |
| 3 | Developing | "We've identified and are working to increase revenue/profitability of low performing SKUs, but not working to dominate the market for our top performers." |
| 4 | Advanced | Routine analysis, consistent improvements |
| 5 | Mastered | "All SKUs go through a routine revenue/profit analysis, dominate the market where possible, and we can increase revenue/profits with predictable results." |

### Key Success Metrics
- CM3% by SKU
- Stock-out frequency
- CTR% and CVR% trends
- BSR trends
- Revenue per SKU

### Infinity Vault Context
**Current Focus**: Pillar 1 of OBG (Asset Optimization)
- Binders: BSR 60k-100k, low CVR, needs improvement
- Box products: Performing well with hands-off approach
- Testing premium positioning ($35 1-pack / $60 2-pack)

---

## Pillar 4: Amazon Advertising (PPC)

### What It Is
Using Amazon's paid advertising platform to drive targeted customer traffic to your listings and increase brand visibility.

### Why It's Crucial
- Can't rely on organic traffic alone
- Essential for visibility in crowded marketplace
- Profitability depends on managing ACoS/TACoS

### Maturity Levels

| Score | Level | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | Beginning | "ACoS, TACoS and other metrics are not meeting targets. We're losing money and/or not spending enough. Not all products have campaigns setup." |
| 2 | Early | Campaigns exist but poorly managed |
| 3 | Developing | "TACoS for the whole account is within 3% of target and ad spend is steady, but we aren't utilizing all ad placements Amazon has to offer for each SKU." |
| 4 | Advanced | Good TACoS, most placements utilized |
| 5 | Mastered | "We're maximizing ad spend at our target TACoS on an individual SKU level and we're utilizing all available Amazon advertising placements." |

### Key Success Metrics
- ACoS by campaign
- TACoS by SKU and account
- Ad spend efficiency
- Placement utilization
- ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)

### Infinity Vault Context
- Current ACoS: High (negative margin)
- Target: <25% ACoS
- Team onboarding for listing/ads management ($500/mo)
- Titan Ignite managing box product ads

## Pillar 5: Audience Utilization

### What It Is
Building a list of customers and potential customers (email list) and actively engaging with them for direct communication.

### Why It's Crucial
- Asset you truly own (not renting from Amazon)
- Generates product ideas
- Ensures successful launches
- Drives repeat sales
- Makes business more defensible

### Maturity Levels

| Score | Level | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | Beginning | "We don't have a list or the list is so cold we should start over." |
| 2 | Early | Small list, not actively used |
| 3 | Developing | "Our list is growing, but we're only successfully using it for product ideas OR launching products OR re-selling people on our list." |
| 4 | Advanced | List growing and used for 2 of 3 functions |
| 5 | Mastered | "We are actively growing our list and using our audience to successfully generate product ideas, launch products, and re-sell to people on our list." |

### Key Success Metrics
- List size and growth rate
- Open rates
- Click rates
- Revenue from email
- Product ideas generated from audience
- Launch support from list

### Infinity Vault Context
- Brand website almost ready
- Email marketing automation planned
- Will address buyer remorse / leaky bucket

## How to Use This Framework

### Quarterly Assessment Process

1. **Score Yourself Honestly**
   - Rate each pillar 1-5 based on actual results
   - Don't rate aspirations, rate reality
   - Use the maturity level descriptions

2. **Find Your Bottleneck**
   - Identify the lowest-scoring pillar
   - If tied, focus on the earlier pillar in sequence
   - (Can't optimize SKUs that don't exist)

3. **Plan for Improvement**
   - Make the weakest pillar your primary strategic goal
   - Focus tasks and projects on improving that one area
   - Build the SYSTEM that keeps the score high

### Assessment Sequence Logic

```
Pillar 1 → Pillar 2 → Pillar 3 → Pillar 4 → Pillar 5
(Products)  (Launch)   (Optimize)  (Traffic)  (Audience)

Can't launch without products
Can't optimize without launched products
Can't drive traffic to unoptimized listings
Can't build audience without traffic
```

### The Goal

> "The goal of improving a low score is not just to brute-force a better result for one month. It's to build or refine the documented process that will keep that score high in the future."

You're not just fixing a problem—you're building the machine that prevents the problem from happening again.
