# Lean GPT Framework

## Overview
The Lean GPT Framework is an AI-optimized approach to building and running businesses that maximizes output while minimizing traditional overhead. It combines lean startup principles with AI capabilities to create highly efficient operations.

## Core Philosophy

### The Lean GPT Equation
```
Value Delivered = (AI Leverage × Human Insight) / (Time × Capital)
```

**Maximize**: AI Leverage, Human Insight, Value Delivered
**Minimize**: Time, Capital, Complexity

## The Four Pillars

### Pillar 1: AI-First Operations
*Default to AI for everything possible*

#### Principles
1. **AI Default**: If AI can do it, AI should do it
2. **Human Premium**: Reserve human time for high-value decisions
3. **Continuous Automation**: Always look for the next thing to automate
4. **Quality Assurance**: Human oversight on AI outputs

#### Implementation
| Function | AI Role | Human Role |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Content | First draft | Review, refine |
| Research | Gather, synthesize | Decide, apply |
| Planning | Generate options | Choose, commit |
| Analysis | Process data | Interpret, act |
| Communication | Draft | Personalize, send |

### Pillar 2: Minimal Viable Everything
*Start with the smallest version that works*

#### Principles
1. **Ship Fast**: Done beats perfect
2. **Iterate**: Small improvements compound
3. **Validate**: Test assumptions before investing
4. **Eliminate**: Remove anything that doesn't add value

#### MVE Checklist
- [ ] What's the simplest version that delivers value?
- [ ] What can be removed without losing core benefit?
- [ ] How quickly can this be validated?
- [ ] What's the cheapest way to test this?

### Pillar 3: Compound Learning
*Every interaction improves the system*

#### Principles
1. **Document Everything**: Capture learnings systematically
2. **Feedback Loops**: Continuous improvement cycles
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify what works repeatedly
4. **Knowledge Base**: Build organizational memory

#### Learning System
```
Execute → Capture → Analyze → Improve → Execute
```

### Pillar 4: Strategic Focus
*One obsession, ruthless prioritization*

#### Principles
1. **OBG Alignment**: Everything serves the main goal
2. **Brutal Prioritization**: Say no to everything else
3. **Constraint Focus**: Break the one bottleneck
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Maximum impact per dollar/hour

**Inputs**: Briefs, templates, examples
**Outputs**: Drafts, variations, refinements

#### 3. Analysis Agent
**Purpose**: Process data and identify patterns
**Inputs**: Data, metrics, trends
**Outputs**: Insights, predictions, alerts

#### 4. Execution Agent
**Purpose**: Complete defined tasks
**Inputs**: Instructions, parameters, context
**Outputs**: Completed work, status reports

#### 5. Strategy Agent
**Purpose**: Evaluate decisions and plans
**Inputs**: Options, criteria, constraints
**Outputs**: Recommendations, risk assessments
