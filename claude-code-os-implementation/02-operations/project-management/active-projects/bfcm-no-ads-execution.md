## Objective

Execute a no-ads, breakeven pricing strategy during Black Friday / Cyber Monday to maximize sales velocity and improve BSR while generating cash flow.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Maintain $15.19 price through BFCM period
- [ ] Keep ads OFF for entire period
- [ ] Track daily sales velocity
- [ ] Monitor BSR movement
- [ ] Generate cash for debt reduction
- [ ] Improve organic ranking through velocity

## Strategy

### Pricing
- **Price**: $15.19 (break-even)
- **Rationale**: Maximize volume during peak traffic, sacrifice margin for velocity

### Advertising
- **Status**: OFF
- **Rationale**: BFCM organic traffic is high; capture without ad spend

### Expected Outcomes
- Higher sales velocity than normal
- BSR improvement
- Cash generation (volume at breakeven)
- Ranking benefit from velocity

|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Pricing live | Complete | Cannot execute strategy |
| Ads turned off | Complete | Spend eats into margin |
| Inventory available | OK | Stock out kills momentum |

## Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Stock out during BFCM | Low | High | Monitor daily, have reorder ready |
| Competitor undercutting | Medium | Medium | Can't control, focus on our execution |
| Lower than expected volume | Medium | Low | Strategy still valid, reduce expectations |

---

## Post-BFCM Actions

1. **Dec 3**: Return to premium pricing (target price TBD)
2. Analyze BFCM results:
   - Total units sold
   - BSR improvement
   - Cash generated
   - Ranking impact
3. Document learnings for next year
4. Feed data into Pillar 1 optimization strategy
