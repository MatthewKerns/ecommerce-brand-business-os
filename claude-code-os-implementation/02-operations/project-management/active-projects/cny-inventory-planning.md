## 🚨 URGENT UPDATE - December 4, 2025

**STATUS**: **CRITICAL - ORDER MUST BE PLACED BY DEC 12**

### Why This Is Urgent NOW
- **TODAY**: December 4, 2025
- **DEADLINE**: December 12, 2025 (**8 DAYS**)
- **Production lead time**: 60 days required before Feb 10 CNY closure
- **If missed**: Stock outs in Q1/Q2 2026 = lost sales + BSR drop + cash flow crisis

### Immediate Actions Required (Dec 4-12)
See detailed action plan in: `/01-executive-office/cash-flow-solution-dec-2025.md`

---

## Objective

Ensure adequate inventory is ordered and shipped from China BEFORE Chinese New Year factory closures to prevent Q1/Q2 2026 stock outs.

### Critical Deadline
> **February 10, 2026**: Inventory must ship from China before CNY holiday

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Calculate Q1-Q2 2026 inventory needs
- [ ] Determine optimal reorder quantity
- [ ] Place order with sufficient lead time
- [ ] Confirm shipment before Feb 10, 2026
- [ ] Avoid Q1/Q2 stock outs

---

## Why This Matters

Stock outs are a **HUGE** killer of:
- Profits (lost sales)
- Cash flow (no revenue)
- Rankings (BSR drops)
- Organic visibility (algorithm penalizes)

CNY causes 2-4 week factory shutdown + shipping delays = potential 6-8 week gap if not planned.

### ⚠️ TIMELINE CHANGE
**ORIGINAL**: Plan was to order in January
**CURRENT**: Must order by Dec 12 due to 60-day production lead time
**REASON**: Feb 10 CNY deadline - (60 days lead time) = Dec 12 latest order date
