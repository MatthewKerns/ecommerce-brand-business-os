| **Status** | ACTIVE |
| **Priority** | P2 (Important - becomes P1 in January) |

## Objective

Ensure adequate inventory is ordered and shipped from China BEFORE Chinese New Year factory closures to prevent Q1/Q2 2026 stock outs.

### Critical Deadline
> **February 10, 2026**: Inventory must ship from China before CNY holiday

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Calculate Q1-Q2 2026 inventory needs
- [ ] Determine optimal reorder quantity
- [ ] Place order with sufficient lead time
- [ ] Confirm shipment before Feb 10, 2026
- [ ] Avoid Q1/Q2 stock outs

---

## Why This Matters

Stock outs are a **HUGE** killer of:
- Profits (lost sales)
- Cash flow (no revenue)
- Rankings (BSR drops)
- Organic visibility (algorithm penalizes)

CNY causes 2-4 week factory shutdown + shipping delays = potential 6-8 week gap if not planned.
