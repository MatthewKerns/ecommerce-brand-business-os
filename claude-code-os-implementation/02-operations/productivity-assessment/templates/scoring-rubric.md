# Productivity Scoring Rubric

## Purpose
Provide objective, consistent criteria for daily productivity scoring to enable accurate tracking and meaningful improvement.

## Scoring Components

### Component 1: Task Completion (40% weight)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 10 | 100% Tier 1 + 100% Tier 2 + Tier 3 progress |
| 9 | 100% Tier 1 + 80%+ Tier 2 |
| 8 | 100% Tier 1 + 50%+ Tier 2 |
| 7 | 100% Tier 1 (no Tier 2 progress) |
| 6 | 80-99% Tier 1 complete |
| 5 | 60-79% Tier 1 complete |
| 4 | 40-59% Tier 1 complete |
| 3 | 20-39% Tier 1 complete |
| 2 | 1-19% Tier 1 complete |
| 1 | 0% Tier 1 complete |

**Notes**:
- Tier 1 = Must complete (critical path)
- Tier 2 = Should complete (important but flexible)
- Tier 3 = Could complete (nice to have)

### Component 2: Strategic Alignment (30% weight)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 10 | 100% of time on OBG-aligned work |
| 9 | 90-99% aligned, minor drift |
| 8 | 80-89% aligned, some unplanned work |
| 7 | 70-79% aligned, noticeable drift |
| 6 | 60-69% aligned, significant non-OBG |
| 5 | 50-59% aligned, half day off-track |
| 4 | 40-49% aligned, major misalignment |
| 3 | 30-39% aligned, mostly off-track |
| 2 | 20-29% aligned, severe misalignment |
| 1 | <20% aligned, day wasted on non-OBG |

**Alignment Definition**:
- Work serves Pillar 1 (Asset Optimization) OR
- Work serves Pillar 2 (Product R&D) OR
- Essential operations that enable Pillar 1/2

**Non-Aligned Examples**:
- Researching unrelated opportunities
- Overengineering solutions
- Meetings without clear OBG connection
- "Interesting" but non-essential work

### Component 3: Time Efficiency (20% weight)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 10 | Actual time within 10% of estimates |
| 9 | Actual time within 15% of estimates |
| 8 | Actual time within 20% of estimates |
| 7 | Actual time within 25% of estimates |
| 6 | Actual time within 30% of estimates |
| 5 | Actual time within 40% of estimates |
| 4 | Actual time within 50% of estimates |
| 3 | Actual time off by 50-75% |
| 2 | Actual time off by 75-100% |
| 1 | Actual time off by >100% |

**Calculation**:
```
Accuracy = 1 - |Planned - Actual| / Planned
```

**Special Cases**:
- Unexpected blockers: Note but still score actual
- Scope changes: Adjust planned time before scoring
- External dependencies: Note impact on variance

### Component 4: Focus Quality (10% weight)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 10 | Deep focus maintained, zero unplanned interruptions |
| 9 | 1-2 minor interruptions, quickly recovered |
| 8 | Few interruptions, good recovery |
| 7 | Some focus breaks, adequate recovery |
| 6 | Noticeable focus issues, scattered work |
| 5 | Frequent interruptions, fragmented day |
| 4 | Poor focus, constant context switching |
| 3 | Very fragmented, little deep work |
| 2 | Almost no sustained focus |
| 1 | Unable to focus, day lost to distraction |

**Focus Indicators**:
- Time in uninterrupted blocks (target: 90+ min)
- Context switch frequency
- Recovery time after interruptions
- Distraction avoidance success

## Score Calculation

### Formula
```
Total Score = (Completion × 0.4) + (Alignment × 0.3) + (Efficiency × 0.2) + (Focus × 0.1)
```

### Example
| Component | Raw Score | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Completion | 8 | 40% | 3.2 |
| Alignment | 9 | 30% | 2.7 |
| Efficiency | 7 | 20% | 1.4 |
| Focus | 6 | 10% | 0.6 |
| **Total** | | | **7.9** |

## Score Interpretation

### 9.0 - 10.0: Exceptional
- All critical work completed
- Perfect strategic alignment
- Efficient execution
- Strong focus maintained
- **Action**: Document what made this day great

### 7.0 - 8.9: Good
- Most critical work completed
- Strong alignment
- Minor inefficiencies
- Good focus overall
- **Action**: Maintain current approach

### 5.0 - 6.9: Average
- Partial completion
- Some alignment drift
- Noticeable inefficiencies
- Focus challenges
- **Action**: Identify and address blockers

### 3.0 - 4.9: Below Average
- Significant gaps
- Major misalignment
- Poor efficiency
- Fragmented focus
- **Action**: Recovery plan needed

### 1.0 - 2.9: Poor
- Little accomplished
- Severely off-track
- Day largely wasted
- Unable to focus
- **Action**: Immediate intervention required

## Special Scoring Situations

### Sick Days / Reduced Capacity
- Score based on reduced expectations
- Note context in assessment
- Don't penalize for legitimate reduced capacity

### External Blockers
- Note blocker and impact
- Score what was controllable
- Identify prevention for future

### Unexpected Opportunities
- If aligned with OBG: Score as normal
- If not aligned: Justify why pursued
- Update strategy if opportunity changes priorities

### Travel / Unusual Days
- Set realistic expectations upfront
- Score against adjusted plan
- Note context

---

## Calibration Guidelines

### Weekly Calibration
- Review week's scores for consistency
- Adjust if scoring too harsh or lenient
- Target: 7.0 average for solid weeks

### Monthly Calibration
- Compare scores to actual outcomes
- Did high-score weeks produce results?
- Adjust rubric if misaligned with reality

### Quarterly Recalibration
- Review scoring criteria relevance
- Update for changed priorities
- Ensure rubric reflects current OBG
