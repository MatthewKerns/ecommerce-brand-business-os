# Brand Voice Guide - Infinity Vault Content Team

## Quick Reference: The Three Principles

Before creating ANY content, remember these three principles:

### 1. Sell the Identity, Not the Box
> Our customer buys products that reinforce their identity as a serious, dedicated player. The Vault is a symbol of prestige, readiness, and belonging.

### 2. Speak the Language of Fantasy
> All imagery, copy, and design must be infused with fantasy genre language. We sell "battle-ready artifacts" - gear that reflects authority, enhances presence, and gains admiration.

### 3. Focus on the Pre-Game Ritual
> The gaming journey begins in the mind long before the first card is played. Support and amplify the excitement, confidence, and anticipation of pre-game preparation.
