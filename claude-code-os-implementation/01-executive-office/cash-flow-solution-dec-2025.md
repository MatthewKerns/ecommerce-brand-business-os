# Cash Flow Solution - December 2025
## CRITICAL: Dec 12 Inventory Order Deadline

**Created**: December 4, 2025
**Status**: 🔴 URGENT - 8 days until deadline
**Priority**: P0

---

## 🚨 Immediate Situation

### The Gap
| Item | Amount | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Immediate need** | $1,000 | Need in bank ASAP |
| **Dec 12 inventory order** | TBD | Must calculate by Dec 6 |
| **Days until deadline** | **8 days** | Clock is ticking |

### Why This Matters
- **Stock out risk**: Missing Dec 12 deadline = potential Q1/Q2 stock outs
- **CNY factory closure**: Feb 10, 2026 - factories close for 2-4 weeks
- **Lead time pressure**: 60-day production + shipping = order must be placed NOW
- **Cash flow domino**: No inventory = no sales = no cash flow = death spiral

## 💡 Strategic Notes

### Why This Is P0
Missing the Dec 12 deadline doesn't just delay inventory - it creates a cascade:
1. Miss Feb 10 ship date = caught by CNY closure
2. CNY closure = 2-4 week delay minimum
3. Stock out in Q1/Q2 = lost sales + BSR drop
4. BSR drop = lower organic rank = harder to recover
5. Lost sales = no cash flow = can't fund other initiatives

**This deadline is non-negotiable.**

### The $1K Question
The user specifically mentioned needing $1K in bank ASAP. This suggests:
- Might be for supplier deposit
- Might be for immediate operational needs
- Might be buffer before larger funding arrives

**Priority**: Get $1K in TODAY/TOMORROW, then focus on full inventory funding.

### Funding Source Strategy
Apply to ALL sources simultaneously. Don't wait for one response before trying others. Time is critical. We can always say "no thanks" later.
