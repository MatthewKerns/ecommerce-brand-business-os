## Quick Selection Flow

```
Morning Question:
"If I could only accomplish ONE THING today, what would have the biggest impact on profitability?"

     ↓

Does it serve Pillar 1 or Pillar 2?
├── Pillar 1 → Is there a test running that needs action?
│              Is there a deadline (like Oct 20)?
│
└── Pillar 2 → Did I protect my 3 hours R&D time?
               What's the next pipeline stage to advance?

     ↓

Set it. Protect it. Do it first.
```

## Integration with Daily Planning

### THE ONE THING should be:
1. First item in Tier 1
2. Scheduled during peak energy hours
3. Started before email/admin
4. Protected from interruptions
5. Completed before moving to Tier 2

### If THE ONE THING Takes All Day
That's okay. Some days the ONE THING is big enough to be the only thing. Don't dilute focus by adding more tasks.

## Weekly ONE THING Pattern

| Day | ONE THING | Completed? |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| Mon | | ⬜ |
| Tue | | ⬜ |
| Wed | | ⬜ |
| Thu | | ⬜ |
| Fri | | ⬜ |

**Completion Rate**: ___/5 days

If <4/5, investigate what's blocking ONE THING completion.

*"Extraordinary results come from a narrow focus applied consistently."*

**For Infinity Vault**: THE ONE THING is either advancing CM3% (Pillar 1) or advancing the pipeline (Pillar 2). Nothing else qualifies.
