## ⛔ Kill List (NOT This Week)

*Things explicitly rejected to protect focus*

1. **New product launches** - R&D continues but no launches this week
2. **PPC optimization deep dives** - Team handling
3. **New tool evaluations** - Focus on what we have
4. **Website feature creep** - Launch MVP, iterate later
5. **Perfectionism on demo video** - Good enough is good enough

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
