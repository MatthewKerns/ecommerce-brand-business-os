# Weekly Strategic Plan
## Week 48 | November 24-30, 2025

**Created**: November 24, 2025
**Phase**: BFCM No-Ads Breakeven Execution

---

## 🎯 OBG Progress Check

**Goal**: Turn Infinity Vault profitable within 12 months
**Current Status**: Executing BFCM strategy to generate volume + BSR improvement
**This Week Target**: Maximize BFCM sales velocity while protecting R&D systematization
**Confidence**: Medium

---

## 🏆 THE ONE THING This Week

> **Systematize operations using ecommerce-brand-business-os while executing BFCM monitoring**

### Why This Matters
- R&D can't happen consistently without systems in place
- BFCM is executing (ads off, price at breakeven) - monitoring only needed
- This week's "downtime" during BFCM is perfect for building operational systems
- Sets up Q1 2026 for disciplined execution

### Success Looks Like
- [ ] 🚨 Company email FIXED and working
- [ ] SellersFi/OnRamp funding conversations initiated
- [ ] Brand website LAUNCHED
- [ ] BFCM sales tracked daily without obsessive monitoring

### Pillar
Both - Systems enable consistent execution of both pillars

---

## ⚖️ Pillar Balance

| Pillar | Current State | This Week Target | Hours Allocated |
|--------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Asset Optimization | BFCM executing (passive) | Monitor only | 3 hours |
| Product R&D | Needs systematization | Build systems + some R&D | 15 hours |
| Operations/Systems | Building OS | Primary focus | 12 hours |

**Note**: This week is unique - BFCM execution is passive (no ads, breakeven price). Use this window to build systems that enable consistent future execution.

## ⛔ Kill List (NOT This Week)

*Things explicitly rejected to protect focus*

1. **Turning on ads** - BFCM strategy is no-ads, stick to it
2. **Changing prices again** - Price updates submitted, let them run
3. **New product orders** - Not until post-BFCM analysis
4. **VA hiring** - Define tasks first, hire later
5. **Obsessive refresh checking** - Set scheduled check times only
6. **Reactive strategy changes** - Follow the plan
7. **Complex R&D work** - Focus on blockers (email, website, funding) this week

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| BFCM sales anxiety leads to reactive changes | High | Stick to scheduled monitoring times |
| Holiday disrupts R&D time | Medium | Accept reduced hours Thu, maximize Mon-Wed |
| Systems work feels less urgent than monitoring | Medium | Remember: Systems enable future R&D |
| Stock out during BFCM | Low | Monitor inventory levels |

---

## 💡 Strategic Notes

### This Week is Unique
BFCM execution is passive - the work was done (pricing set, ads off). This creates a rare window to build systems without sacrificing execution.

### Temptation to Avoid
The anxiety of watching BFCM sales will tempt constant monitoring. Resist. Set 3 check times per day max. Use freed time for systems work.

### Key Insight from Strategy Session
> "Prioritize product research and development even with everything else going on"

Systems enable consistent R&D. This week: build the systems.

### Post-BFCM Transition (Dec 3)
- Return to premium pricing
- Resume active optimization testing
- Continue R&D with new systems in place
