# Brutal Prioritization Framework

## The Spartan Rule
> "Lean operations through one obsession and brutal elimination."

This framework helps you ruthlessly cut what doesn't serve the OBG.

## Step 1: Brain Dump

List EVERYTHING you're considering doing this week:

### Work Tasks
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.

### Ideas/Opportunities

## Step 2: OBG Filter

For each item above, score against OBG alignment:

| Item | OBG Alignment (0-100%) | Pillar Served | Verdict |
|------|------------------------|---------------|---------|
| | | 1 / 2 / Neither | DO / DEFER / DROP |
| | | 1 / 2 / Neither | DO / DEFER / DROP |
| | | 1 / 2 / Neither | DO / DEFER / DROP |
| | | 1 / 2 / Neither | DO / DEFER / DROP |
| | | 1 / 2 / Neither | DO / DEFER / DROP |
| | | 1 / 2 / Neither | DO / DEFER / DROP |
| | | 1 / 2 / Neither | DO / DEFER / DROP |
| | | 1 / 2 / Neither | DO / DEFER / DROP |

### Scoring Guide
- **90-100%**: Critical path to OBG → DO
- **70-89%**: Important support → DO if capacity
- **50-69%**: Nice to have → DEFER
- **<50%**: Distraction → DROP

## Step 3: Time Reality Check

### Available Time This Week
| Category | Hours |
|----------|-------|
| Total waking hours | |
| Fixed commitments | |
| R&D time (non-negotiable) | 21 |
| Self-care/breaks | |
| **Available for other work** | |

### Task Time Estimates
| DO Items | Estimated Hours |
|----------|-----------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| **Total** | |

### Capacity Check
- Available: ___ hours
- Required: ___ hours
- **Gap**: ___ hours

**If gap is positive**: Capacity exists, proceed
**If gap is negative**: MUST cut more items

---

## Step 4: The Elimination Round

### What MUST be cut?
*If over capacity, these items get dropped or deferred*

| Item | Cut or Defer? | Why | When to Revisit |
|------|---------------|-----|-----------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### The Kill List
*Explicitly rejected to protect focus*

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

**Mindset reminder**: Saying NO to these is saying YES to OBG.

---

## Step 5: Priority Stack

### Final Priority Order
*Rank your DO items from most to least important*

1. **[#1 Priority]** - ___ hours
   - Why first:
   - Blocked by:
   - Blocks:

2. **[#2 Priority]** - ___ hours
   - Why second:
   - Blocked by:
   - Blocks:

3. **[#3 Priority]** - ___ hours
   - Why third:
   - Blocked by:
   - Blocks:

4. **[#4 Priority]** - ___ hours

5. **[#5 Priority]** - ___ hours

### The Cut Line
*Everything below this line only happens if above items complete early*

## Step 6: Constraint Identification

### What's the ONE bottleneck?
> [Identify the single constraint that, if broken, would unlock the most progress]

### How to break it this week:

## Prioritization Principles

### DO prioritize:
- Direct OBG advancement
- Constraint-breaking activities
- Time-sensitive deadlines
- High-leverage actions (small effort, big impact)

### DON'T prioritize:
- "Good ideas" without validation
- Activities that feel productive but aren't
- Other people's priorities (unless aligned)
- Perfectionism on non-critical items

### Questions to Ask:
1. "If I could only do ONE thing, what would it be?"
2. "What would I regret NOT doing this week?"
3. "What am I doing just because I started it?"
4. "What would a ruthless CEO cut?"

---

## Quick Decision Framework

For any new request or idea during the week:

```
Does it serve OBG?
├── NO → DROP (politely decline)
└── YES → Is it more important than current #1 priority?
          ├── NO → Add to backlog
          └── YES → Replace current priority (rare!)
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Signs You're Not Being Brutal Enough:
- [ ] More than 5 "priorities" for the week
- [ ] Saying "maybe" instead of "no"
- [ ] Adding items without removing items
- [ ] Feeling scattered across many things
- [ ] R&D hours getting squeezed

### Recovery:
1. Stop everything
2. Re-run this framework
3. Cut 50% more than feels comfortable
4. Protect R&D time as sacred

---

## Weekly Prioritization Ritual

**When**: Sunday evening or Monday morning
**Duration**: 30 minutes maximum
**Output**: Clear priority stack and kill list

### Checklist:
- [ ] Brain dump complete
- [ ] OBG filter applied
- [ ] Time reality checked
- [ ] Eliminations made
- [ ] Priority stack ordered
- [ ] Constraint identified
- [ ] Kill list documented
