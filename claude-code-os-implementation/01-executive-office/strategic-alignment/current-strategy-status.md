## Open Questions / Waiting On

1. **Account management team docs** - Need to plug in their processes
2. **VA hiring** - Which systems to delegate first?
3. **Website platform** - Which platform to launch on?
4. **Email marketing tool** - Which tool for automation?

## Strategic Reminders

> "Prioritize product research and development even with everything else going on"

The temptation during BFCM is to focus 100% on current sales. But Pillar 2 (R&D) is the long-term growth engine. Must protect R&D time even during busy periods.
