## Alignment Quick Check

Before any task, ask:

```
Does this serve the OBG?
├── YES → Does it serve Pillar 1 or Pillar 2?
│         ├── Pillar 1 → Improves CTR/CVR/CM3%?
│         └── Pillar 2 → Advances pipeline?
└── NO → Don't do it
```

### Scoring
- **90-100%**: DO IT NOW
- **70-89%**: Schedule this week
- **50-69%**: Add to backlog
- **<50%**: DROP IT
