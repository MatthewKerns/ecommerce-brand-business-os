# Strategic Alignment Checklist

## Purpose
Use this checklist to verify any task, project, or decision aligns with the OBG and strategic priorities before committing time and resources.

## Quick Alignment Check (30 seconds)

### The Three Questions

**1. Does it serve the OBG?**
- [ ] YES - Continue
- [ ] NO - STOP (Don't do it)

**2. Which pillar does it serve?**
- [ ] Pillar 1: Asset Optimization (CTR/CVR/CM3%)
- [ ] Pillar 2: Product R&D (Pipeline)
- [ ] Neither - STOP (Don't do it)

**3. Is it higher priority than current work?**
- [ ] YES - Consider switching
- [ ] NO - Add to backlog or drop

## Full Alignment Assessment

### Task/Project: ________________________

### Section 1: OBG Alignment

| Question | Answer | Score |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Does this directly advance profitability? | Y/N | +40 if Y |
| Does this improve CTR, CVR, or CM3%? | Y/N | +20 if Y |
| Does this advance the product pipeline? | Y/N | +20 if Y |
| Is this the best use of time for OBG? | Y/N | +10 if Y |
| Would OBG suffer if this wasn't done? | Y/N | +10 if Y |

**OBG Alignment Score**: ___/100

### Section 2: Pillar Check

**Pillar 1: Asset Optimization**
- [ ] Improves main image/listing quality
- [ ] Advances price testing/strategy
- [ ] Enhances PPC efficiency
- [ ] Directly increases conversion
- [ ] Directly increases click-through

**Pillar 2: Product R&D**
- [ ] Generates new product ideas
- [ ] Screens/validates concepts
- [ ] Advances supplier relationships
- [ ] Moves pipeline forward
- [ ] Prepares for product launch

**Pillar Served**: 1 / 2 / Both / Neither

### Section 3: Priority Check

| Current Priority | This Task |
|------------------|-----------|
| P1: Price Strategy | Higher / Lower / Equal |
| P2: Listing Optimization | Higher / Lower / Equal |
| P3: R&D Pipeline | Higher / Lower / Equal |
| P4: PPC Refinement | Higher / Lower / Equal |

**Should this displace current priorities?**: Y/N

### Section 4: Resource Check

| Resource | Required | Available | Feasible? |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Time | hrs | hrs | Y/N |
| Money | $ | $ | Y/N |
| Energy | H/M/L | H/M/L | Y/N |
| Focus | Days | Days | Y/N |

**Resource feasibility**: Y/N

### Section 5: Timing Check

- [ ] Must be done now (deadline-driven)
- [ ] Should be done this week (important)
- [ ] Could be done this month (beneficial)
- [ ] Could wait indefinitely (nice to have)

**Urgency**: High / Medium / Low

## Alignment Decision Matrix

| OBG Score | Pillar | Priority | Decision |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| 90-100% | 1 or 2 | Top 2 | DO NOW |
| 90-100% | 1 or 2 | Lower | SCHEDULE |
| 70-89% | 1 or 2 | Any | CONSIDER |
| 50-69% | 1 or 2 | Any | BACKLOG |
| <50% | Any | Any | DROP |
| Any | Neither | Any | DROP |

---

## Final Verdict

Based on this assessment:

- [ ] **DO NOW** - High alignment, high priority, resources available
- [ ] **SCHEDULE** - High alignment, but not top priority right now
- [ ] **BACKLOG** - Moderate alignment, do when capacity allows
- [ ] **DELEGATE** - Aligned but doesn't need your direct involvement
- [ ] **DROP** - Insufficient alignment, don't do it

**Decision**: _________________________

**Rationale**: _________________________

## Red Flags (Auto-Drop)

If any of these are true, DROP the task:

- [ ] Can't articulate OBG connection in one sentence
- [ ] Serves neither pillar
- [ ] "It might be nice to..."
- [ ] "Everyone else is doing..."
- [ ] "It won't take long..."
- [ ] Scratches an itch but doesn't move metrics

---

## Green Flags (Strong Consideration)

- [ ] Directly moves a key metric (CTR/CVR/CM3%/Pipeline)
- [ ] Breaks a current constraint
- [ ] Time-sensitive with clear deadline
- [ ] High leverage (small input, big output)
- [ ] Compounds over time

---

## Usage Notes

1. **Use this BEFORE starting new work** - not after
2. **Be honest** - don't rationalize misaligned tasks
3. **Speed over perfection** - 30-second check for most items
4. **Full assessment for big decisions** - projects, investments, pivots
5. **Update when OBG changes** - checklist should reflect current strategy

---

## Alignment Audit (Weekly)

At weekly review, assess:

| This Week's Work | Aligned? | Should Have Done? |
|------------------|----------|-------------------|
| | Y/N | |
| | Y/N | |
| | Y/N | |

**Alignment Rate**: ___% (Target: >90%)

If <90%, investigate why misaligned work happened.
