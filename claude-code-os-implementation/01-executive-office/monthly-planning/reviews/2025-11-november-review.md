## Pillar Performance Review

### Pillar 1: Asset Optimization

#### Metrics Summary
| Metric | Month Start | Month End | Change | Target |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| CTR% | Low | Getting clicks via category targeting | Slight improvement | +30% |
| CVR% | Low on root keyword | Low on root keyword | No change | +20% |
| CM3% | Negative | Negative | No change | Positive |
| BSR | ~60k | 60k-100k | Declining | Top 50 |

#### Tests Completed
| Test | Result | Learning | Action Taken |
|------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Title front-loading (1-Pack/2-Pack/Scratch Resistant) | Inconclusive | Too many variables changed simultaneously | Live - monitoring |
| Main image update (Oct 17) | Inconclusive | Need isolated testing period | Live - monitoring |
| Break-even price test (Oct 25) | Lose | Low price alone didn't drive ranking | Abandoned |
| Reference price establishment (Oct 30) | Lose | Lost strikethrough on main variation | Pivoted to premium |
| Premium price test ($35/$60) | In Progress | Early - few sales at list price | Holding |
| Category targeting ads | Inconclusive | 45 clicks / 0 sales (7 days) | Monitoring |

#### Key Achievements
1. Titles optimized with key differentiators front-loaded
2. Main images updated
3. Competitor research updated in Titan tools
4. SQP report analyzed
5. Team onboarding initiated ($500/mo for listing/ads management)
6. Brand website almost ready to launch

#### Gaps/Misses
1. Multiple variables changed simultaneously (price + bids + images)
2. Strikethrough lost and not recovered
3. BSR declined from ~60k to 60k-100k range
4. CVR on root keyword still low (multi-month issue)
5. Reactive changes driven by scarcity mindset
6. Pricing video and strategy replay not yet watched

#### Pillar Health Score: 4/10
*Foundation laid but execution discipline lacking*

---

### Pillar 2: Product R&D

#### Pipeline Progress
| Stage | Month Start | Month End | Target |
|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Ideas Generated | 0 | 0 | 100+ |
| Ideas Screened | 0 | 0 | 5-10 |
| Concepts Validated | 0 | 0 | 2-3 |
| Launch-Ready | 0 | 0 | 1 |

#### R&D Time Investment
- **Target**: 84 hours (21/week x 4 weeks)
- **Actual**: ~5-10 hours (estimate)
- **Variance**: -88% to -94%

#### Key Achievements
1. Binder keyword analysis started (partial)
2. Awareness of need for systematic R&D process

#### Gaps/Misses
1. No ideas generated or documented
2. Software projects and job search consumed R&D time
3. No systematic process implemented
4. Pipeline remains empty

#### Pillar Health Score: 2/10
*Not progressing - time allocation is the constraint*

## Pattern Recognition

### What Consistently Worked
1. **Hands-off approach for box products** - Titan Ignite managing, minimal intervention = good performance
2. **Price at top of market** - Some sales at $35/$60 list price before strikethrough loss
3. **Team delegation** - Recognizing need for help and acting on it

### What Consistently Failed
1. **Changing multiple variables at once** - Price + bids simultaneously = no learnable data
2. **Reactive changes based on daily/weekly anxiety** - "Maybe if I set price to X..."
3. **Deferred learning** - Pricing video and strategy replay still unwatched
4. **R&D time protection** - Other priorities consistently won

### Emerging Patterns
| Pattern | Frequency | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Scarcity mindset -> reactive changes | Every price/bid decision | Need scheduled testing cadence |
| Low sales -> panic -> change something | Weekly | Team management + discipline |
| R&D deprioritized for "urgent" items | Daily | Block time as non-negotiable |
| Box products outperform binders | Consistent | Apply same hands-off approach to binders |

### Constraint Analysis
**This month's main bottleneck was**: Reactive decision-making driven by cash flow pressure

**Was it broken?**: No - pattern identified but not yet changed

**Next constraint to break**: Personal discipline around scheduled testing + R&D time protection

## Time Allocation Analysis

### Planned vs Actual (Estimate)
| Category | Planned Hours | Actual Hours | Variance |
|----------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Pillar 1: Optimization | 40 | 25 | -38% |
| Pillar 2: R&D | 84 | 8 | -90% |
| Software Projects | 0 | 40+ | N/A (competing priority) |
| Job Search | 0 | 15 | N/A (necessary) |
| Reactive Tinkering | 0 | 20 | N/A (waste) |

### Time Leaks Identified
1. Software projects consuming R&D time
2. Reactive price/bid changes (time spent deciding, changing, worrying)
3. Not watching educational content (pricing video, strategy replay)

### Time Optimization Opportunities
1. Team manages binders -> reclaim 10+ hours/week
2. Job secured -> reduce job search time, ease cash pressure
3. Scheduled testing -> eliminate reactive tinkering time
4. Block R&D time as non-negotiable calendar appointments

## Strategic Alignment Check

### OBG Alignment Score
**How much of this month's work directly served the OBG?**

- [ ] 90-100%: Excellent focus
- [ ] 70-89%: Good focus
- [x] 50-69%: Moderate drift
- [ ] <50%: Significant drift

### Strategic Drift Analysis
**Activities that didn't serve OBG**:
1. Software project work (necessary for different reason but not OBG-aligned)
2. Reactive price/bid changes (activity without strategy)
3. Worrying without action (pricing video still unwatched)

**Why did they happen?**:
- Cash flow pressure created scarcity mindset
- Software projects have near-term income potential
- Emotional response to low sales numbers

**Prevention for next month**:
- Team handles binder operations -> removes temptation to tinker
- Job interview success -> reduces cash pressure
- Scheduled testing protocol -> removes reactive decisions
- Blocked R&D time -> protects Pillar 2

## Learnings & Insights

### Top 3 Learnings

1. **Learning**: Changing multiple variables simultaneously makes optimization impossible
   - Evidence: Can't determine if titles, images, or pricing caused any changes
   - Application: One variable per test, minimum 7 days, let team enforce discipline

2. **Learning**: Hands-off approach works (box products vs binders)
   - Evidence: Box products performing well with Titan Ignite, minimal owner intervention
   - Application: Replicate for binders via team delegation

3. **Learning**: Scarcity mindset drives counterproductive behavior
   - Evidence: "I keep thinking maybe if I spend a bunch more on ads... or set price to X"
   - Application: Job interview success + team support should reduce pressure; build scheduled discipline

### Assumptions Validated
| Assumption | Status | Implication |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Premium positioning can work ($35/$60) | Partially validated | Got some sales at list price before strikethrough issues |
| Need team help to scale | Validated | Found $500/mo option, onboarding |
| Root keyword CVR is a real problem | Validated | Low for months, expensive to target |

### Assumptions to Test Next Month
1. Does team management + hands-off approach improve binder performance?
2. Can we recover strikethrough through consistent premium pricing?
3. Will structured testing cadence produce actionable data?

## System Improvements

### What's Working in the OS
1. Strategic framework provides clear pillars and metrics
2. OBG keeps focus on profitability goal
3. Documentation captures learnings for future reference

### What Needs Improvement
| Issue | Proposed Solution | Priority |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Reactive decision-making | Scheduled testing cadence, team gatekeeping | HIGH |
| R&D time unprotected | Calendar blocks, job security to reduce pressure | HIGH |
| Educational content deferred | Watch pricing video + replay this week | HIGH |
| Brand website not launched | Finish and launch in December | MEDIUM |

## Review Sign-Off

**Date Completed**: November 24, 2025

**Overall Month Rating**: 4/10

**Key Emotion**: Frustration (progress made but not breakthrough)

**One Word to Describe the Month**: Reactive

**Commitment for Next Month**:
> "I will trust my team with binder operations, protect my R&D time as non-negotiable, and resist the urge to make reactive changes. Scheduled discipline beats anxious activity."

*"November taught me what doesn't work. December is about applying that learning. Trust the team. Protect the R&D time. Stop tinkering."*
