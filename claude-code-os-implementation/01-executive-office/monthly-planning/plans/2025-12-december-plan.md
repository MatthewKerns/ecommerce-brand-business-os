# Monthly Plan - December 2025

## Month Theme
> **"Disciplined Delegation + R&D Activation"**

## THE ONE THING for December
> **Transition binder operations to team while launching systematic R&D process**

---

## Context from November

### What We Learned
1. Changing multiple variables at once = no actionable data
2. Hands-off approach works (box products prove it)
3. Scarcity mindset drives counterproductive reactive changes
4. R&D time gets deprioritized without protection

### What Changes in December
- Team manages binder operations (owner steps back)
- Scheduled testing replaces reactive tinkering
- R&D time is protected as non-negotiable
- Owner focuses on strategic oversight, not tactical execution

## Risk Anticipation

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Job interview doesn't convert | Medium | Continue search, adjust cash expectations |
| Team underperforms | Medium | Weekly check-ins, clear success criteria, escalation path |
| Scarcity mindset returns | High | No ad console access except scheduled; accountability |
| R&D time still gets deprioritized | High | Calendar blocks; track hours; accountability partner |
| BSR continues declining | Medium | Accept for now; focus on conversion not rank |
| Holiday disruption | Medium | Realistic Week 4 expectations; pre-plan light days |

---

## Kill List for December

| Kill | Why |
|------|-----|
| Daily price/bid tinkering | Team handles; owner reviews weekly |
| Logging into ad console outside schedule | Removes temptation for reactive changes |
| New optimization ideas without team | Funnel through team process |
| Perfectionism on R&D ideas | Quantity over quality in generation phase |
| Scope creep on brand website | Launch MVP, iterate later |
| Working through holidays | Rest is strategic; Week 4 is light by design |

---

## Daily Non-Negotiables

1. **R&D time**: Minimum 2 hours/day (except holidays)
2. **No reactive changes**: If urge arises, write it down for weekly review
3. **Team trust**: Do not log into ad console outside scheduled reviews
4. **Documentation**: Log R&D hours and ideas daily

## Weekly Non-Negotiables

1. **Huddles**: Attend weekly huddle sessions
2. **Work Parties**: Attend weekly work parties
3. **Team Check-in**: Wednesdays, 30 min

---

## Accountability Structure

### Weekly Team Check-in (Wednesdays, 30 min)
- Team reports on metrics and tests
- Owner provides strategic input only
- No tactical decisions in the meeting

### Weekly Self-Review (Sundays, 15 min)
- R&D hours logged vs target
- Ideas generated vs target
- Reactive changes made (should be zero)
- Adjustments for next week

---

## Month-End Success State

4. **Strategic discipline proven** - Zero reactive changes for 4 weeks
5. **Q4 reviewed** - Clear learnings documented
6. **January plan ready** - Validation tests scheduled

## Commitment

> "December is about proving I can delegate, protect R&D time, and resist reactive impulses. If I can do this for one month, I can do it forever. Trust the team. Trust the process. Trust the plan."
