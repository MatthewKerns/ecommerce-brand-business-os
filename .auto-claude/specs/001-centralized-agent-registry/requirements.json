  "task_description": "# Centralized Agent Registry\n\nCreate a unified registry that catalogs all AI agents with their capabilities, prompts, input/output specifications, and invocation methods. Enables discoverability and consistent agent management.\n\n## Rationale\nCurrently agent prompts are scattered across multiple markdown files making it hard to understand what agents exist and how to use them. A centralized registry addresses the technical debt and mirrors how Obsidian users struggle with plugin management (pain-2-2, pain-2-6).\n\n## User Stories\n- As a user, I want to see all available agents in one place so that I know what capabilities the system has\n- As a developer, I want agent definitions standardized so that I can easily add or modify agents\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Single JSON/YAML file contains all agent definitions\n- [ ] Each agent has documented inputs, outputs, and trigger methods\n- [ ] Agents can be listed via /agents command\n- [ ] Agent prompts are validated for required fields\n- [ ] Documentation auto-generated from registry\n",
