  "feature": "Automatic Session Context Loading",
  "description": "# Automatic Session Context Loading\n\nImplement automatic loading of relevant context at the start of each session including recent work, active projects, current OBG, and pending tasks. No manual context restoration required.\n\n## Rationale\nThis is THE #1 differentiator vs ChatGPT/Claude workflows (pain-6-1, gap-1). Every competitor AI tool requires users to re-explain their situation each session. Automatic context loading transforms the user experience from 'starting over' to 'continuing where you left off'.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a user, I want the AI to remember what I worked on yesterday so that I don't waste time re-explaining context\n- As an entrepreneur, I want my strategic goals always present so that every conversation stays aligned with my OBG\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Session starts with summary of last session's work within 5 seconds\n- [ ] Active projects and their status automatically available to AI\n- [ ] OBG and current tier priorities loaded without user action\n- [ ] Context includes last 7 days of productivity scores\n- [ ] Users can override with '/fresh' to start clean session\n",
