## Selection Guide

### Quick Reference Table

### Personalization Tips

If you have **20-50 characters remaining** after base variant:

1. **Add specific content reference** (if space allows):
   - "Your [specific video type] content" → "Your vintage pack opening content"
   - "Your community" → "Your [platform] community" or "Your [TCG name] community"

2. **Add creator name** (high impact):
   - "Hey [Name]!" at the beginning (adds ~10-15 chars including space)
   - Only do this if you have room - generic is better than cut-off text

3. **Reference specific platform** (if multi-platform):
   - "your followers" → "your TikTok community" or "your Instagram fam"

**Character Count Warning**: TikTok truncates at exactly 500. Test in the platform before sending to ensure no cut-off mid-sentence.
